"105677","Abdul Latif Jameel Health and iSono Health join forces to bring the world’s first AI-driven portable 3D breast ultrasound scanner to potentially help hundreds of millions of women in over 30 countries across the Global South","Press Release","<ul>
	<li>Partnership announced at the Abdul Latif Jameel Health stand at Arab Health, the region’s most influential healthcare event.</li>
	<li>iSono Health’s FDA cleared<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a> ATUSA system allows for automated whole breast ultrasound imaging at point of care without need for trained ultrasound operators.</li>
	<li>Abdul Latif Jameel Health’s mission is to accelerate affordable access to health for those who need it most, utilizing innovative health tech.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://aljhealth.com/home"">Abdul Latif Jameel Health</a>, part of international diversified family business <a href=""https://alj.com/en/"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a>, has announced a new distribution agreement with <a href=""https://isonohealth.com/"">iSono Health</a>, a medical technology company in San Francisco, USA, with the vision to transform breast care with automated imaging and artificial intelligence (AI)<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership, announced on the first day of Arab Health 2023, the Middle East’s most influential healthcare event, will see Abdul Latif Jameel Health become the exclusive distributor of iSono Health’s ATUSA scanner in the Global South, making it available to hundreds of millions of women in an initial 31 countries covering the Middle East and North Africa, Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/AigpKW_MEr4"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>The female-founded iSono Health is transforming breast imaging with a first-of-its-kind, compact automated whole breast ultrasound system featuring a unique wearable accessory and an intuitive, intelligent software for automated image acquisition and analysis.  The patented and FDA cleared ATUSA system is a compact ultrasound scanner that captures 3D images through automated scanning of the whole breast in just two minutes, independent of operator expertise.  The device connects to laptop or tablet for real-time image acquisition and 3D visualization; the data is transferred to a secure cloud for storage.  The ATUSA system is designed from ground up to seamlessly integrate with machine learning models that will give physicians a comprehensive set of tools for decision making and patient management.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/maryamziaei/"">Maryam Ziaei</a>, PhD, Founder and CEO, iSono Health, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This new partnership is a significant milestone in our history and an important step forward in making our ATUSA scanner accessible to millions more women across the world.  Working with Abdul Latif Jameel Health will empower so many more women to access the healthcare they need, to improve patient experiences and to bring peace of mind.  </em></p>
<p><em>“We have been able to develop a scanner which takes two minutes to scan and makes breast imaging painless and convenient.  We’re very much looking forward to bringing this technology to the region and making a lasting, sustainable impact.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the World Health Organization<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[3]</a>, breast cancer is the world’s most prevalent cancer; one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[4]</a>.  Access to personalized and efficient breast imaging is critical in every step of patient journey from screening to detection to treatment, surgery, and monitoring.  The ATUSA system is designed to offer enhanced efficiency, consistent accuracy, and a comfortable patient experience, therefore making 3D breast ultrasound imaging accessible to patients and physicians at point of care, around the world.</p>
<p>The agreement will see Abdul Latif Jameel Health distribute the ATUSA scanner across the Middle East and North Africa as well as African markets including South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, in addition to South Asia covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, and Southeast Asian territories of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand and Brunei.</p>
<p><a href=""https://aljhealth.com/en/our-people/akram-bouchenaki/"">Akram Bouchenaki</a>, Chief Executive Officer, Abdul Latif Jameel Health said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Working with Maryam Ziaei, </em><em>and </em><em>Shadi Saberi, co-founders with PhDs in Engineering, and the whole iSono Health team has made it clear what a perfect synergy we share in our vision to improve access to healthcare, eliminate the disparity in health equity across the world, and how using state of the art health tech will help us achieve these goals.  Their ATUSA scanner is one of the most innovative pieces of technology I have witnessed in my career, and I know it will very soon become one of the most valuable products used by physicians and for healthcare systems.  This is an important moment for those in medical imaging but more importantly for women’s health across the Global South.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last year, Abdul Latif Jameel Health announced the creation of its new international commercial ecosystem, helping to accelerate access to modern medical care and drive health inclusivity across the Global South.  The network of confirmed partners will cover key markets across a wide geographic area and will see on-the-ground distribution of Abdul Latif Jameel Health approved products into hospitals, clinics and medical institutions to fast-track health inclusion for those who need it most.</p>
<p>Akram Bouchenaki added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At Abdul Latif Jameel Health, we are delivering on our promise of offering an integrated ‘one-stop’ managed service to medical devices, pharmaceutical products, diagnostic and therapeutics manufacturers to afford them multi-market access more rapidly than they could manage individually.  We will distribute their products to the populations that can most benefit from them sooner, meeting unmet medical needs, driving healthcare inclusivity, and in parallel, opening the unrealized commercial potential of these markets.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since its launch in 2020, Abdul Latif Jameel Health has developed strong relationships with renowned health partners utilizing innovation and industry disruptive approaches to deliver healthcare in more efficient ways.  Partners include Butterfly Network, EQRx, Cyberdyne, Evelo Biosciences, Melody International, Holoeyes Inc., and now, iSono Health.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel Health was created as a response to the ongoing global disparity in access to modern medical care, focusing on accelerating healthcare inclusion across the Global South.  Reflecting the Jameel Family’s long-established commitment to innovating for a better future, Abdul Latif Jameel Health works in the commercial environment to address tangible real-world needs today, for a better tomorrow.  It works with partners from around the world to open and grow new markets for distribution of existing solutions and investing in the future of MedTech. </p>

	<li>FRV Australia expanded its activities to New Zealand in 2021 when it formed a joint venture with Genesis Energy.</li>
	<li>The 52MW development is the first project of the Joint Venture that will deliver up to 500MW of solar capacity over the next five years.</li>
	<li>Expected to be operational in 2024, the Lauriston solar site is among the most advanced large-scale solar sites in the country.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://frv.com/en/tag/australia/"">Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Australia</a>, a leading developer of sustainable energy solutions, and part of <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/energy-overview/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Energy</a> and <a href=""http://www.omersinfrastructure.com/"">OMERS</a>, has further expanded its activities in New Zealand by acquiring a large scale solar site near Lauriston on the Canterbury Plains.  The acquisition was made possible due to FRV Australia’s joint venture (JV) agreement with Genesis Energy, a New Zealand publicly listed electricity generation company, and the largest electricity and natural gas retailer in the country.</p>
<p>[video width=""1280"" height=""720"" mp4=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2023/02/Abdul-Latif-Jameel-Energy-FRV-Lauriston-NZ-EN-VO-Subs-C.mp4"" poster=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2023/02/Lauriston-Poster-Image.jpg""][/video]</p>
<p>FRV Australia and Genesis Energy formed a JV in late 2021 to develop up to 500MW of solar capacity over the next five years in New Zealand. This is expected to generate about 750GWh pa, which is enough to power 100,000 households or 185,000 EVs per year.</p>
<p>Located one hour’s drive from Christchurch, Lauriston Solar Farm is a planned 52MW project located on a 93-hectare site. Once operational, it will power the equivalent of 9,800 houses. It is expected to create more than 50 jobs during the construction phase.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/fady-jameel/"">Fady Jameel</a>, Deputy President and Vice Chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The joint venture with Genesis Energy is further evidence of our commitment to entering new markets, while supporting sustainable infrastructure development to provide clean energy to thousands of homes and businesses. On top of this, our acquisition of Lauriston, one of the most advanced solar sites in the country, represents an important milestone in the realization of our vision to develop up to 500MW of solar capacity over the next five years in New Zealand.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FRV Australia CEO, Carlo Frigerio, said that the site ticked a lot of boxes and will be up and running quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“FRV Australia and Genesis have worked together during the past year and developed a very promising pipeline of solar projects expected to be delivered in the coming years. Lauriston solar farm is posed to be the first large scale solar farm reaching operational stage in the country”.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FRV Australia Chief Business Development Officer, Tarek Alsampaile, also added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>""The Lauriston solar farm marks our first and most advanced solar farm in New Zealand, and we are thrilled to contribute to the rapid growth of the country's solar energy market.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FRV’s regional expansion further strengthens and deepens Abdul Latif Jameel Energy’s expertise in the solar energy market, building on its already strong pipeline of green energy assets across the globe. It also consolidates OMERS Infrastructure’s leading position in infrastructure and renewable investments across different regions. </p>
<p>Christopher Curtain, Senior Managing Director, Asia-Pacific, OMERS Infrastructure, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We are proud to support FRV Australia with this first project of the partnership with Genesis in New Zealand. Supporting energy transition remains a priority for OMERS Infrastructure, so we are pleased the joint venture between FRV Australia and Genesis has reached this important milestone.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>""With the start-up of San Serván 400 we continue to strengthen our presence in Extremadura, Spain, which remains a priority location where we have great prospects for the future. In addition, the generation of clean, renewable energy from this plant will allow us to continue contributing to the decarbonization of our energy sector and others, and to their independence from fossil fuel sources"".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Félix Bolaños said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Extremadura is at the forefront of renewable energy in Spain and Europe. The ecological transition is fundamental to Spain's development, hence all the effort the government is making to ensure that our country becomes a world power in renewable energy by 2050. The investments being made today in San Servan are investments for the future of Spain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guillermo Fernández-Vara commenting on the sidelines of the ceremony said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""This is just the tip of the iceberg. Behind it comes a change in the model of life, consumption, employment, development, and the possibility of placing Spain at the forefront of the world. We have an opportunity as a country, and Extremadura as a region, that we never had before with the arrival of these projects, and we have to know how to rise to the occasion.”</p>

	<li>Almar Water Solutions continues international expansion through new partnership agreement in the Asia-Pacific region, aiming to eventually enter the European and North American markets.</li>
	<li>The parties aim to jointly develop opportunities in the region, taking on large projects involving water infrastructure, urban and industrial services management, and digital solutions.</li>
	<li>The collaboration marks the second urban water services platform for Almar Water Solutions, with the first being in Chile.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://almarwater.com/"">Almar Water Solutions</a>, a leading business in developing and managing water infrastructure and services, and part of <a href=""https://alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/energy-overview/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Energy</a>, is expanding its geographical presence to the Asia-Pacific market through a partnership agreement with <a href=""http://www.moyaasia.com/"">Moya Indonesia Holdings Pte. Ltd</a>. (Moya Indonesia), to jointly develop their water businesses across the region.</p>
<p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/VRFmo32lLfg"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>The first milestone of this new agreement is the acquisition of a 50% stake in Obor Infrastructure Pte. Ltd. (Obor Infrastructure) by Almar Water Solutions. This marks Almar Water Solutions’ second entry into the urban services market, following <a href=""https://almarwater.com/almar-water-solutions-expands-its-activities-in-chile-and-acquires-50-of-the-urban-services-company-aguas-san-pedro-s-a/"">the acquisition of 50% of Aguas San Pedro in Chile last year</a>. The collaboration underscores Almar Water Solutions’ commitment to supporting local communities by creating regional service platforms with local partners.</p>
<p>Obor Infrastructure, a holding enterprise established in Singapore, owns two water companies each operating a water treatment plant on the Indonesian island of Java, with a total capacity of 425,000 m<sup>3</sup>/day, and plans to increase the capacity by an additional 160,000 m<sup>3</sup>/day in the short to medium term. These supply drinking water to several districts in Greater Jakarta, the second-largest urban area on the planet.</p>
<p>This partnership agreement will draw on the value of Moya Indonesia's extensive experience and knowledge of the local market, combined with the global experience and capabilities of Almar Water Solutions in the development, financing and management of water infrastructure and service enterprises. The aim of both parties is to jointly develop opportunities across the Asia-Pacific region, from large desalination, water and wastewater treatment projects, to the management of urban and industrial services, and the development of technological solutions in the field of digitalization.  </p>
<p><a href=""https://alj.com/en/our-people/fady-jameel/"">Fady Jameel</a>, Deputy Chairman and Vice Chairman, Abdul Latif Jameel, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Our expansion to the Asia Pacific region is in line with our unwavering commitment to address the water security needs of the world’s growing population. We look forward to working closely with our partners to design and deliver innovative water solutions that are at the core of nourishing healthy ecosystems and sustainable development.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://alj.com/en/our-people/carlos-cosin/"">Carlos Cosín, CEO of Almar Water Solutions,</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Asia Pacific is a key market for Almar Water Solutions, where we can provide value in infrastructure management, open the industrial market in the region, bring digital transformation to the country and provide solutions based on non-conventional technologies that increase the availability of water resources. Entering the market accompanied by Moya Indonesia is a privilege; the company is a leader in water treatment in Indonesia and is a strategic player in the water sector in the region. This transaction also reconfirms our commitment to the urban water market, improving the drinking water supply and the lives of millions of people in the region.” </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A delegation including His Royal Highness Prince Khalid Bin Sultan, Chairman of SAMF, and Munir Khoja, Managing Director of Marketing Communication at Abdul Latif Jameel Motors, was taken for a special tour of TMC facilities involved in the development of sports vehicles.

<p>Productive discussions took place on increasing GR vehicles’ participation in motorsports in Saudi Arabia, including the Saudi Toyota Championship. Organized by SAMF, the Championship is the largest of its kind in the Kingdom and features a diverse line-up of events such as rallies, drifting, time attack, autocross, drag racing, and hill-climbing. Spanning seven cities including Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Asir, Al Baha, Qassim, and Hail, the Saudi Toyota Championship represents a qualitative leap in the world of local racing that has attracted over 300 participants to date.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness Prince Khalid Bin Sultan, Chairman of the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation, said:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>TGR was established in 2015 ?to consolidate Toyota’s motorsports activities under one in-house brand and represents a fundamental pillar of the company’s commitment to ?creating ‘ever-better’ cars. The TGR team actively participates in numerous different forms of motorsports ?including the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) and the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC). In recent years, TGR has found great success in these events with eco-friendly vehicles such as the GR YARIS Rally1 Hybrid and the GR010 Hybrid, including winning the legendary 24 hours of Le Mans endurance race an incredible five times in succession. Toyota harnesses the experience gained under the extreme ?conditions of motorsports to forge new ?technologies and solutions, with the goal of bringing the freedom, adventure, and joy of driving to everyone.</p>
<p>Made for motorsport enthusiasts by motorsports enthusiasts, Toyota’s GR line-up represents the embodiment of climate-conscious sports vehicles. Abdul Latif Jameel Motors offers an extensive range of GR models to customers in the Kingdom including the Land Cruiser, Supra, Hilux, and GR86.</p>
<p>Munir Khoja, Managing Director of Marketing Communication at Abdul Latif Jameel Motors, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As part of our strategic relationship with both TMC and SAMF, Abdul Latif Jameel Motors is committed to promoting the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals and initiatives towards a greener future.

TMC's dedication to realizing hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars aligns with our values and our mission to improve mobility in the Kingdom. We look forward to celebrating these special moments and promoting sustainable mobility for all.”</em></p>

<p>The guests also visited the facilities of Rookie Racing, a private team owned by TMC Chairman Akio Toyoda.

	<li>The GR Saudi Driving School welcomes Saudi male and female motorsports enthusiasts aged 18 to 26 in the Kingdom.</li>
	<li>A platform for aspiring racers to exhibit their abilities and develop their skills towards a career as professional racers.</li>
	<li>Final four drivers will compete in the upcoming season of the Saudi Toyota Championship.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://www.toyota.com.sa/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Motors</a>, an authorized distributor of Toyota vehicles in Saudi Arabia for nearly 70 years, and the <a href=""https://samf.gov.sa/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation</a> (SAMF) proudly announce the launch of the <a href=""https://grsaudidrivingschool.com/"">Gazoo Racing (GR) Saudi Driving School</a>.  This initiative is set to discover exceptional Saudi talent for the GR Saudi Team and foster their skills and passion across four exhilarating disciplines: Time Attack, Hill Climb, Drift, and Autocross. The GR Saudi Driving School not only empowers the youth but also serves as a platform for them to unlock their full potential in the world of motorsports.</p>
<p><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-108296"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2023/06/GR-Saudi-Driving-School-logo-with-black-background_EN-300x169.jpg"" alt=""GR Saudi Driving School"" width=""300"" height=""169"" />Registration for the driving school is now open, and in August the facility will welcome young Saudi men and women aged 18 to 26 who have a passion for motorsports.  The temporary facility will operate for five days and provide an opportunity for participants to exhibit their abilities. The objective of the school is to identify talented drivers, assist them in honing their skills, and nurture them into professional racers.</p>
<p>Prospective applicants must demonstrate their motorsport knowledge and passion through a detailed application. Then, from the pool of applicants, 60 individuals will be chosen to undergo further evaluation, which includes a personal interview, a rigorous fitness test, and a comprehensive drive and safety examination.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness Prince Khalid Bin Sultan, Chairman of the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Together, we embark on a journey to identify and develop promising racers who embody the spirit of excellence and passion for motorsports. This initiative is a testament to our dedication to providing opportunities for aspiring drivers to showcase their skills on national and international platforms. As we strive to cultivate a new generation of drivers who will uphold the rich legacy of motorsports in Saudi Arabia, we are confident that this partnership will unearth remarkable talent representing our nation’s best.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chosen 60 participants will be invited to a five-day driving school in Jeddah, where they will receive training from renowned driving instructors. Through a series of intensive courses and practical sessions, these aspiring racers will acquire the essential skills and knowledge necessary to compete at the highest level.</p>
<p>Following the driving school, the final four exceptional drivers will be selected to represent the GR Saudi Team to compete in the upcoming season of the Saudi Toyota Championship. These talented individuals will be equipped with cutting-edge GR vehicles, including the Yaris GR, GR 86, and Supra, ensuring they have the best tools to excel in their respective disciplines.</p>
<p><a href=""https://alj.com/en/our-people/hassan-jameel/"">Hassan Jameel</a>, Chairman of the Board of Managers of Abdul Latif Jameel Motors, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Our collaboration with the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation represents a crucial step towards uncovering untapped talent in Saudi Arabia. This initiative provides an incredible opportunity for young Saudi men and women to showcase their skills and reinforces our commitment to the growth and development of motorsports in the Kingdom. We look forward to uncovering exceptional drivers who will proudly represent the GR Saudi Team and make their mark in the Saudi Toyota Championship.""</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Saudi Toyota Championship, the four drivers will be assigned a unique discipline: Autocross, Drift, Time Attack and Hill Climb. Autocross involves racing against time inside a circuit with a specific track and cones, where drivers must reach the finish line in the shortest time while following safety rules. Drift is a form of motor racing where two vehicles compete to cross a finish line first. Time Attack is similar to Autocross but takes place on a longer circuit. Finally, in Hill Climb, drivers race a distance of 3 km, mostly uphill on an asphalt road, to complete the race in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Abdul Latif Jameel Motors and SAMF contributes to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030’s 'Quality of Life' program by empowering the youth and shaping the future of motorsports. Aspiring racers can now unleash their full potential and compete professionally while representing the prestigious GR Saudi Team.</p>
<p>A recent YouGov survey on consumer attitudes and behaviors revealed that motorsports are highly favored in Saudi Arabia, ranking second among sports. Abdul Latif Jameel Motors and SAMF are fueling the growth of motorsports by nurturing exceptional talent and pioneering new opportunities.</p>
<p>Their unwavering dedication is pushing the sport forward and enabling men and women in Saudi Arabia to pursue their dreams of becoming motorsport champions globally.</p>","","6/6/2023 9:27","https://clone.alj.com/en/news/abdul-latif-jameel-motors-and-samf-to-unearth-new-talent-for-saudi-arabias-racing-scene/","","","","","","","","https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2023/06/Racing-Track.jpg","989396","1","en","{""total"":927,""to_translate"":{""ar"":927,""zh-hans"":927,""fr"":927,""ja"":927,""es"":927,""tr"":927}}","1","","1686009600","","167","","New talent for Saudi Arabia's racing scene","<p>Abdul Latif Jameel Motors and the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation (SAMF) launches the Gazoo Racing (GR) Saudi Driving School to discover talented drivers for the GR Saudi Team</p>

Last year’s winners Sébastien Buemi, Brendon Hartley and Ryo Hirakawa, in the No.8 GR010 Hybrid Electric Hypercar, battled through turbulent weather conditions, technical setbacks and some of the world’s staunchest competitors to deliver a spectacular performance that won them second place in front of a 325,000-person crowd.</p>
<p>This year also commemorates Toyota's 25th participation at the Le Mans 24 Hours since its debut in 1985. Furthermore, it marks its 12th year of competing in Hybrid Electric Hypercar, further highlighting its dedication to technological innovation in endurance racing and creating ever-better cars for its customers through motorsports.</p>

<p>The epic day-long battle for a historic victory in the legendary French race’s centenary edition saw TGR, the five-time World Champions, take on the challenge of a record 16-car Hypercar field featuring competitors from Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot and Porsche. What ensued was an exciting battle with spectacular wheel-to-wheel racing that put the entire team’s spirit and determination to the test.</p>
<p>Throughout the day’s perilous closing stages, the No.8 GR010 Hybrid Electric Hypercar maintained its unwavering focus and relentless pace, allowing it to secure second place and extend the team’s drivers’ World Championship lead to 25 points. Toyota has also maintained its manufacturers’ World Championship, which now stands at 18 points.</p>
<p>Koji Sato, President of Toyota Motor Corporation and Chairman of TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Europe, commented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who supported us. Sébastien, Brendon, and Ryo pushed themselves as athletes and created a car that could fight for victory. Together with Morizo (Akio Toyoda), the team tackled this challenge, supported by Uchiyamada, Chairman Emeritus, who continues to support Toyota's efforts in the WEC. No matter what the circumstances, I am immensely proud of every member of the team, as this achievement is the result of their unwavering efforts and unyielding spirit. Challenging one’s limits takes tremendous courage. I believe that courage is what propels us toward shaping the future. This year's Le Mans has taught us how to approach the next 100 years. Thank you for all your support. We will continue to fight.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Le Mans 24 Hours also saw Akio Toyoda, Toyota Motor Corporation Chairman, unveil the GR H2 Racing Concept, a hydrogen engine vehicle prototype, during a press conference at the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) at Circuit de la Sarthe in western France. The prototype was also put on display at ACO's ""H2 Village"" at the Le Mans 24 Hours venue throughout the duration of the race.</p>

<p>The GR H2 Racing Concept's introduction was prompted by the ACO's announcement that hydrogen-engine vehicles would be allowed to compete alongside fuel-cell electric vehicles in the race’s hydrogen category. Toyota, whose objective is to achieve carbon neutrality in motorsports while maintaining exceptional performance and excitement, looks forward to redefining the concept of race cars across the next century.</p>
<p>Over the years, Toyota has been participating in many different forms of motorsports, including Formula One, the World Endurance Championship (WEC), and the Nürburgring 24 ?Hours endurance race. Toyota’s participation in these events was overseen by separate entities within the company until April 2015, when Toyota established TGR, ?to consolidate all of its motorsports activities under one in-house brand.</p>
<p>Representing ?Toyota’s belief that ‘the roads build the people, and the people build the cars’, Abdul Latif Jameel Motors and the Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation (SAMF) launched the <a href=""https://grsaudidrivingschool.com/"">Gazoo Racing (GR) Saudi Driving School</a> to discover exceptional Saudi talent for the GR Saudi Team and foster their skills and passion across four exhilarating disciplines: Time Attack, Hill Climb, Drift, and Autocross. Registration for the driving school is now open, and in August the facility will welcome young Saudi men and women aged 18 to 26 who have a passion for motorsports.</p>
<p>The next leg of the 2023 FIA WEC is the 6 Hours of Monza at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Italy, scheduled to take place on July 9, 2023.</p>

	<li>In alignment with Vision 2030, the GR Saudi Driving School positions Saudi Arabia as a global hub for motorsports, emphasizing the Kingdom’s innovation, empowerment, and leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://www.toyota.com.sa/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Motors</a>, an authorized distributor of Toyota vehicles in Saudi Arabia for nearly 70 years, and the <a href=""https://samf.gov.sa/en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Saudi Automobile and Motorcycle Federation</a> (SAMF) proudly announce the opening of the <a href=""https://grsaudidrivingschool.com/"">Gazoo Racing (GR) Saudi Driving School.</a> The temporary school will open between 15 – 20 August 2023, located at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit parking lot. With a staggering 2000 registrations, 60 were shortlisted, where 20 participants are from Jeddah, Riyadh, and the Eastern Region each. Notably, the inclusion of nine female participants demonstrates the increasing interest to venture into motorsports.</p>
<p>The GR Saudi Driving School is more than a training ground; it's a visionary platform designed to identify, nurture, and elevate the next generation of racers for the GR Saudi Team in four exciting disciplines: Time Attack, Hill Climb, Drift, and Autocross. After a rigorous two-day training program, five students from each region will be shortlisted, making a total of 15 students. These 15 will then undergo a final training and assessment at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit. Out of these, four exceptional racers will be chosen to represent the GR Saudi Team, marking their entry into the esteemed Saudi Toyota Championship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“With 60 participants, the GR Saudi Driving School is not just about discovering talent; it's about shaping the future of motorsports in Saudi Arabia.

</blockquote>
<p>The meticulously designed five-day program will be facilitated by renowned driving instructors: <a href=""https://abakhashab.com/"">Abdullah Bakhashab</a>, <a href=""https://www.paulspooner.net/about"">Paul Spooner</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hatim_natto/"">Hatim Natto</a>. Their combined expertise ensures participants receive unparalleled guidance, elevating their potential.

<p><a href=""https://alj.com/en/our-people/hassan-jameel/"">Hassan Jameel</a>, Chairman of the Board of Managers of Abdul Latif Jameel Motors, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The GR Saudi Driving School exemplifies Abdul Latif Jameel Motors’ commitment to excellence, innovation, and leadership. The initiative is more than just a school; it's a platform that empowers and shapes the next generation of racers, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to compete and excel on the world stage.

</blockquote>
<p>The four winners will compete in their respective disciplines, which include: Autocross, Drift, Time Attack, and Hill Climb. Autocross involves racing against time on a circuit with a specific track and cones. Drivers must follow safety rules and reach the finish line in the shortest time possible. Drift racing emphasizes car control and style, with drivers intentionally oversteering to slide through corners and earning points for speed, angle, line, style, and flair. Time Attack is similar to Autocross but takes place on a longer circuit. Finally, in Hill Climb, drivers race uphill on an asphalt road for 3 km to complete the race in the shortest time possible.</p>

Aspiring racers can now unleash their full potential and compete professionally while representing the prestigious GR Saudi Team.</p>

"109823","Abdul Latif Jameel Energy’s FRV Australia on track to be a leading solar developer in New Zealand with three new solar sites","Press Release","<ul>
	<li>FRV Australia and Genesis Energy have secured lands for three new sites for solar farms in New Zealand’s North Island.</li>
	<li>Once built, the three solar farms will generate enough electricity to power approximately 85,000 homes.</li>
	<li>The new sites are part of FRV Australia and Genesis Energy’s plan to develop up to 500MW of solar capacity in New Zealand.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://frv.com/en/tag/australia/"">Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Australia</a>, a leading developer of sustainable energy solutions, and part of Abdul Latif Jameel Global Energy and Environment Holding Company Limited (“<a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/energy-overview/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Energy</a>”) and <a href=""http://www.omersinfrastructure.com/"">OMERS</a>, has further expanded its activities in New Zealand securing three new solar sites in the country, which it completed with its  joint venture (JV) partner <a href=""https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/"">Genesis Energy</a>, a New Zealand publicly listed electricity generation company.</p>
<p><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/ctkG8OfB99Q"" width=""560"" height=""314"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe></p>
<p>The solar farms will be developed on New Zealand’s North island in Manawatu, Waikato and Hawke’s Bay with an expected capacity of 200MW, 100MW and 100MW respectively. The three sites will generate enough electricity to power approximately 85,000 homes per year, about <a href=""https://www.stats.govt.nz/tools/2018-census-place-summaries/wellington-city"">the size of Wellington</a>, the capital of New Zealand. These three solar farms will remove approximately 500,000 tons of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel generation annually.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, FRV Australia and Genesis’ joint venture agreed to acquire the Lauriston solar farm, an advanced stage project in Canterbury with 52MW capacity. The combined generation of the four sites - 452 MW - puts the company on track to achieve the JV targets, set in 2021, of securing up to 500 MW of solar projects within five years.</p>
<p>Carlo Frigerio, CEO of FRV Australia, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The new sites under development are the outcome of the ongoing successful joint efforts between FRV Australia and Genesis. They form an important part of our strategy aimed at developing sustainable energy solutions as part of our mission to drive the global energy transition towards a cleaner future. We are deeply committed to working with world-class partners to realise our development ambitions in New Zealand following our highly successful ventures in Australia.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rebecca Larking, Chief Operations Officer at Genesis, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Solar provides a strong alternative source of renewable generation to the country’s heavy reliance on hydro and growth in wind generation with the added benefit that the time to build and start delivering electricity is a lot quicker than any other type of generation. This will help jumpstart electrifying and decarbonizing New Zealand businesses and households at scale ensuring the country is on track to be net zero by 2050.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christopher Curtain, Senior Managing Director and Head of Asia-Pacific, OMERS Infrastructure, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>""OMERS Infrastructure remains committed to OMERS’ ongoing investments in energy transition opportunities, strategically expanding our global portfolio. We are excited by the opportunity to invest in New Zealand’s energy sector, alongside Genesis, a like-minded partner. Together, we can advance our collective efforts to facilitate a shift to greener and more sustainable infrastructure.""</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://alj.com/en/our-people/daniel-sagi-vela/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Daniel Sagi Vela</a>, Chief Executive Officer, FRV, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These three new sites are the testament to  FRV Group’s determination to become the leading developer of solar generation in New Zealand. Securing these lands puts us well on track for the realization of our vision to develop 500MW of solar capacity over the next five years in New Zealand. Alongside our partner Genesis Energy, we are committed to supporting sustainable infrastructure development in New Zealand as part of our global efforts towards a cleaner future for all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FRV Australia and Genesis Energy formed a JV in late 2021 to develop up to 500MW of solar capacity over the next five years in New Zealand. This is expected to generate about 750GWh pa, which is enough to power 100,000 households or 185,000 EVs per year. The confirmation of the three latest sites follows the progress with another large- scale solar site near Lauriston on the Canterbury Plains. Once operational, Lauriston Solar Farm will power the equivalent of 9,800 houses.</p>
<p>FRV Australia is one of the largest solar developers, asset owners and renewable energy platforms in Australia with over 1GW of PV assets developed, built or under construction across ten projects for a total project investment of over 2 billion dollars across different states. The company draws on its global experience and knowledge of the technology and the supply chain that will prove valuable in the installation, commissioning, and operations of the sites.</p>","","8/29/2023 5:34","https://clone.alj.com/en/news/abdul-latif-jameel-energys-frv-australia-on-track-to-be-a-leading-solar-developer-in-new-zealand-with-three-new-solar-sites/","","","","","","","","https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2023/08/1-scaled.jpg","989554","1","en","{""total"":843,""to_translate"":{""ar"":843,""zh-hans"":843,""fr"":843,""ja"":843,""es"":843,""tr"":843}}","1","","1693267200","","193","","FRV Australia secures solar farm sites in New Zealand","<p>Abdul Latif Jameel Energy’s FRV Australia on track to be a leading solar developer in New Zealand with three new solar sites</p>
