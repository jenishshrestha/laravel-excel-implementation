12386,J-WAFS: How smart investment is forging answers to one of mankind’s biggest challenges,"<h4 class=""p1-style"">Over the next 80 years, the world’s population is set to grow at an unprecedented rate. By 2030, the United Nations predicts the global population will reach 8.5 billion – a rise of 1.2 billion in just 15 years from 2015. Forecasts go on to predict a population of 9.7 billion by 2050, and then 11.2 billion by 2100[1].</h4>
<p>These figures are startling, not only because the rate of population growth is so high, but also because much of this growth is expected to take place in the parts of the world that are already struggling to meet the food and water needs of the current population. The inevitable pressures on our planet, including dramatic changes in land use and impact on the environment, only magnify the food and water security challenges, as they are integrally connected.</p>
<p>Securing access to clean water is already one of the biggest challenges faced by governments around the world. Although 70 percent of the world is covered by water, only 0.007 [R1] percent of that is readily available as useable freshwater for human consumption[2]. Approximately 20 percent of the world’s current population live in areas where water is scarce[3]. Increasing pressures on already limited resources mean another 500 million people are approaching this situation.</p>
<p>Worryingly, the outlook could get worse. Almost a quarter of the world’s population live in countries that have adequate natural water supplies, but do not have the infrastructure needed to purify and distribute water from rivers and aquifers.</p>
<p>As populations in these countries grow, the combined effects of water scarcity and economic water shortages mean that by 2025, two-thirds of the world could be living under conditions of ‘water stress’.[4]</p>
<p>Alongside this, World Bank data[5] suggest that at least 50 percent more food production will be needed by 2050, at a time when climate change is expected to have significant impacts on water availability and crop yields in the many of the most vulnerable parts of the world.</p>
<p>The current situation is clearly not sustainable.</p>
<h5><strong>The Middle East Impact</strong></h5>
<p>It is not hard to imagine that the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) region – already the world’s driest region and home to 12 of the world’s most water-scarce countries – could be at the forefront of any impending food and water crisis. Such a scenario would likely result in profound societal and economic impacts.</p>
<p>The World Bank believes that water scarcity could be a major driving force behind migration, possible conflict, and increased food prices over the next 30 years.</p>
<p>The World Bank says that volatile food prices are already “the new normal,” and suggests that high food prices lead to poor families “pulling their children out of school and eating cheaper, less nutritious food. This can have severe life-long effects on the social, physical, and mental well-being of millions of young people.”[6]</p>
<p>Water scarcity, meanwhile, has a direct effect on people’s employment prospects. The United Nations estimates that almost 80 percent of the world’s active workforce is in jobs either heavily water-dependent (such as agriculture, forestry, inland fisheries, food and power generation) or moderately water-dependent (such as construction, recreation, transportation, and manufacturing).[7]</p>
<p>For the Arab region, water scarcity has a particular impact in rural areas, where the depletion of groundwater resources is one factor contributing to falling income levels. Water scarcity is also cited, alongside poor agricultural productivity and low levels of irrigation efficiency, as having a direct effect on job creation and retention in the region’s rural areas.[8]</p>
<h5><strong>No Time for Complacency</strong></h5>
<p>It is arguable that the urgency and scale of the problems presented by water scarcity and food security are yet to receive full public discussion. Neither issue has entered mainstream discourse in the same way that climate change has, for example. For a significant number of the world’s population, these are underappreciated challenges. However, they are not problems that can be ignored.</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to address the issues. However, the turnaround has been delivered by building energy-intensive desalination plants. So rather than depleting its freshwater reserves, the country is now consuming increased levels of fossil fuels to secure its water supply – which is clearly not a long-term answer.</p>
<p>Addressing these pressing problems requires an altogether different approach; one that combines world-class research and innovation with global investment and implementation.</p>
<h5><strong>Investing in Sustainable Future Success</strong></h5>
<p>In 2014, <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mohammed Jameel</a> established the Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security Lab (J-WAFS) with a major endowment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, and in 2015 Community Jameel (the sustainable social enterprise arm of renowned Saudi business Abdul Latif Jameel) made another substantial award to launch the J-WAFS Solutions Program.</p>
<p>J-WAFS harnesses the knowledge and experience of some of the world’s leading experts and innovators to research, develop, and commercialize the next generation of technologies to tackle water supply and food security issues.</p>
<p>J-WAFS is aligned with the rather unique Community Jameel vision to “help communities help themselves” by striving to address societal issues at their source rather than simply alleviate the symptoms. J-WAFS is honored to have the support of <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Mohammed Jameel</a>, himself a noted MIT alumnus. Thanks to his vision and backing, the lab is able to bring together faculty and students across a range of disciplines including engineering, science, urban planning, management, and social science. The lab provides funding for faculty, postdocs, and students, to advance new technologies to the point where they are positioned to attract venture funding and form the basis for new companies. The lab will also pursue international partnerships.</p>
<p>J-WAFS awards seed grants of US$ 100,000 per year for up to two years for innovative research that has the potential to have significant impact on issues of water and food supply. Seventeen projects are currently active, addressing issues ranging from electro-chemical separation process for contaminated water, to using fungal yeasts to convert waste to food.</p>
<p>With the additional support from Community Jameel in 2015, the reach of J-WAFS was extended further with the launch of the J-WAFS Solutions program. Managed through a partnership with the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, the J-WAFS Solutions program aims to help MIT faculty and students commercialize breakthrough technologies by transforming promising ideas into innovative products and cutting-edge spinout companies.</p>
<p>J-WAFS Solutions has the mission of moving water and food technologies from labs at MIT into the commercial world, to help improve the productivity, accessibility, and sustainability of the world's water and food systems.</p>
<p>J-WAFS Solutions provides grants annually to MIT teams through a competitive application process with a focus on technologies that can address major food and water problems. To date, six projects have been funded and one spinout company is already being launched. Developing technologies as varied as inexpensive water filters for rural India and sensors that can detect bacterial contaminants in meat, these projects aim to improve lives across the world.</p>
<p>In the following paragraphs, we take a look at just a small selection of some of these initiatives.</p>
<h5><strong>Making Desalination Sustainable</strong></h5>
<p>The research projects and developments funded by J-WAFS Solutions are varied, but each aims to contribute to a shared goal.</p>
<p>A team lead by Gang Chen, Carl Richard Soderberg Professor in Power Engineering and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, for example, is aiming to develop an economical technology for desalination on a distributed scale.[9]</p>
<p>As freshwater reserves deplete around the world, several regions are increasingly relying on desalination to boost water supply. However, traditional desalination processes are both costly and energy intensive. Finding a clean, efficient way to conduct desalination is, therefore, of huge environmental and commercial interest, and Gang Chen’s innovation offers significant hope.</p>
<p>The team is developing a special tarpaulin structure (a Wavelength-selective, Insulating-thermally, Solar-powered Still, or ‘WISPS’) that can float on the surface of oceans and lakes to generate freshwater onsite.</p>
<p>Easy to install and made with commercially available materials, the WISPS structure features several characteristics that can harness solar power to fuel the desalination process. By combining WISPS with a simple water condensation system, Chen’s innovation has the potential to deliver clean water production from seawater at low capital costs and competitive production costs.</p>
<h5><strong>Reducing the Impact of Air Pollution on Crop Yields</strong></h5>
<p>Another vital J-WAFS project is researching the impact of air pollution on crop yields.[10]</p>
<p>The Earth’s growing human population is exerting tremendous pressure on the global food supply. Environmental stresses put food security at even greater risk. Ozone air pollution is known to damage crops, costing the agricultural sector billions of dollars in lost yields. Yet our understanding of the impact of air pollution on food production is incomplete – a situation which this project seeks to address.</p>
<p>By modeling and measuring crop response to air pollutants, the researchers led by Colette Heald, associate professor in the Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, aim to estimate the impact of particulate air pollution on both present-day and 2050, crop yields. The objective is to provide the first comprehensive estimate of the food production risks associated with air pollution. The resulting analysis will provide vital new insights into the food security risks associated with air pollution and the need for local scale crop adaptation.</p>
<h5><strong>Safer to Drink, Safer to Eat – Monitoring Food &amp; Water-Borne Contaminants</strong></h5>
<p>At the other end of the chain from food production, is, of course, consumption.</p>
<p>Real-time monitoring of contaminants [12] has become a priority in meeting the need for clean water; similarly, the globalization of our food supply chains has driven the need for new detection platforms that can be employed at the point of consumption. A team led by Michael S. Strano, Carbon P. Dubbs Professor of Chemical Engineering; and Anthony J. Sinskey, Professor of Microbiology and Health Sciences &amp; Technology conceived and developed an integrated platform that brings together many isolated individual contaminant detection techniques into a single portable point-of-consumption use that can simultaneously test for bacteria, heavy metals, and/or allergens.</p>
<h5><strong>Leading the Global Conversation</strong></h5>
<p>J-WAFS is not simply a vehicle to provide financial support to research projects, however. The lab is now a global leader in the field of water scarcity and food security, and plays an active role in the academic and commercial community trying to tackle these challenges.</p>
<p>In October 2016, J-WAFS paired with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance (GCWDA) to host a low-carbon desalination expert workshop. Invited experts from 11 countries came to MIT to discuss the latest advances and best strategies for reducing the energy requirements and carbon footprint of desalination.</p>
<p>Maria Zuber, MIT’s Vice-President for Research, addressed the workshop participants, noting that the work being done at the workshop was “crucially important.” The attendees prepared a report [13] that was delivered during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22), held in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November 2016.</p>
<p>J-WAFS’s ability to support water and food research at MIT has recently been further advanced by the recent signing of its first corporate research affiliate agreement. Xylem Inc., a global water technology company with operations in more than 150 countries, will sponsor research projects over the duration of the three-year agreement with J-WAFS. Xylem will also support the MIT Water Club, a student network for water research and innovation actives. By partnering with Xylem, J-WAFS promotes meaningful collaborations around real-world challenges by bringing to MIT a partner with exceptional experience in the water sector.</p>
<h5><strong>Building a Better Future</strong></h5>
<p>Water scarcity and food security are without doubt two of the biggest challenges humankind has ever faced. Solving them will require investment and collaboration on a global scale. New technologies will need to be developed. Governments will need to collaborate with academia and the private sector with the understanding that the health, prosperity, and economic security of most of the world’s people is at risk if solutions are not found.</p>
<p>Ban Ki-moon, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, said: “Water is essential to decent jobs and sustainable development. Now is the time to increase investments in protecting and rehabilitating water resources, including drinking water, as well as sanitation.”[14]</p>
<p>His assessment is shared by all at Community Jameel and J-WAFS. We must work together to push forward with innovations and ideas to deliver safe and secure food and clean and renewable water supplies, both in the Middle East and in the wider world.</p>
<p>By doing so, we can help to develop the innovative technologies and partnerships necessary to secure the future of our communities, the sustainability of our cities, and the prosperity of our economies for decades to come.</p>

12996,Leading Saudi Arabia’s renewable energy revolution,"<p><strong>As the global population grows and urbanization continues, governments around the world are transforming their thinking on how best to meet their future energy needs.</strong></p>
<p>According to the United Nations, the global population will reach 8.5 billion by 2030 – up 1.2 billion from 2015.  This figure is predicted to increase to 9.7 billion by 2050<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>.  At the same time, more people are living in urban areas.  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs predicts that the proportion of urban population will increase to around 66 percent by 2050, up from 30 percent in 1950.  In Saudi Arabia, the figure is dramatically higher, at just under 90 percent by 2050<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>This high rate of population growth and urbanization inevitably poses big questions for the sustainability of our societies and the ability of our planet to support to such vast numbers of people living in close quarters.  In particular, it creates unprecedented pressures on energy demand and supply.</p>
<p>Energy demand in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) region is set to grow 7 percent annually until at least 2020, while the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies expects energy consumption in Saudi Arabia to treble by 2030.</p>
<p>Not only is this growth unsustainable in terms of resources, it is generally accepted that emissions from fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are material contributors to climate change and damaging to our natural environment.</p>
<h5><strong>Water security – an added complication</strong></h5>
<p>In the MENAT region, the problems are further complicated by the issue of water scarcity.  More than half of the region’s population live under conditions of ‘water stress’, where demand outstrips supply<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a>. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s<em> Vision 2030</em> recognizes the importance of water scarcity, committing the country to promoting <em>“the optimal use of our water resources by reducing consumption and utilizing treated and renewable water”.</em></p>
<p>Historically, one of the key solutions to water scarcity has been desalination – facilities that turn sea water into drinking water.  However, the current approach to desalination is not sustainable.  It is energy intensive, relies on abundant oil, and comes at enormous environmental cost.  Desalination plants worldwide emit an estimated 76 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, a figure that is expected to treble by 2040.</p>
<h5><strong>Renewables the answer?</strong></h5>
<p>Against this backdrop, Saudi Arabia is increasing its focus on renewable energy as a cornerstone in building the solution to the current unsustainable energy model.  It is not hard to see why: Saudi’s climate makes it an ideal location for both solar and wind energy projects, and this opens significant investment opportunities in the energy sector to power domestic economic and technology-skills development.</p>
<p>The Government set a target of delivering 9.5GW of renewable energy by 2030, as part of its <em>Vision 2030<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4""><strong>[4]</strong></a></em> and 3.5GW by 2020 as a strategic objective of the National Transformation Plan<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</a> agenda, and is encouraging private sector investment to accelerate and underpin the achievement of this goal.  The potential savings are significant, with research suggesting that fulfilment of these targets could cut power sector fossil fuel consumption by 25 percent by 2030<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>Saudi Energy Minister HE Khalid Al Falih, speaking at the recent World Future Energy summit in Abu Dhabi in January 2017, raised the bar even higher, bringing forward the 9.5GW target date to 2023, via a combination of solar, wind and geothermal power projects.</p>
<p>The Government formally fired the starting gun on these plans last month, inviting bids for a new program to build wind and solar power plants aimed at generating 700MW of power.</p>
<h5><strong>Reduced costs, cleaner air, more jobs</strong></h5>
<p>As well as the potential to attract significant investment into Saudi Arabia, renewable energy could provide GCC countries with savings of up to US$ 87 billion and cut up to one gigaton of carbon emissions<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>The expansion of the renewables sector should also have a positive impact on jobs, skills and training in the country.  The number of jobs supported by the global renewable energy industry is set to triple by 2030, with a potential for up to 80,000 of those in Saudi Arabia alone<a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>Omar Al-Madhi, Senior Managing Director at Abdul Latif Jameel Investments and Chief Executive Officer at Abdul Latif Jameel Energy Saudi Arabia, one of Saudi Arabia and the GCC’s leading renewable energy producers, believes the benefits of renewable energy are ever more compelling.  <em>“Renewable energy presents the potential to create new jobs, new skills and new opportunities for the local population.  By localizing technology and transferring knowledge, we can provide a strong foundation on which the Saudi renewables industry can thrive,”</em> he says.</p>
<h5><strong>Delivering sustainable desalination</strong></h5>
<p><img class=""alignright"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/03/alj-perspective-desalination-plant.jpg"" alt=""Desalination Plant"" align=""middle"" /></p>
<p>Renewable energy could also be a major step towards developing sustainable desalination plants to help address the challenges of water security, by co-locating renewable energy power plants alongside desalination plants.</p>
<p>Although new technologies are making desalination more efficient, they are still at the early stages of development.  Renewable technologies such as solar thermal, solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, and geothermal energy, however, can provide a much more immediate solution.</p>
<h5><strong><br />
What are the best renewable energy opportunities for Saudi Arabia?</strong></h5>
<p><img class=""alignnone wp-image-5520 size-full"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/03/alj-perspective-meteonorm-yearly-normal-direct-Irradiation.jpg"" alt=""alj-perspective-meteonorm-yearly-normal-direct-irradiation"" width=""752"" height=""283"" /></p>
<p>With its climate and topography, the three renewable energy technologies with the most potential to transform energy production in Saudi Arabia are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Solar: With its sunny climate and vast stretches of flat land, Saudi Arabia is an ideal location for solar power plants.  It possesses one of the highest solar irradiation locations on Earth and it already has much of the expertise and infrastructure to connect solar power into the grid.  As the technology behind solar panels develops and becomes more suitable to Saudi Arabia’s environment, the country’s potential is undoubtedly enormous.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Wind: The country’s wind energy potential is often underappreciated, but no less powerful.  Three Saudi regions are particularly suitable for wind energy, which becomes economically viable at average wind speeds of six meters per second.  In the country’s northeast and central regions, as well as those near mountains in the west, average wind speeds are around eight meters per second.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Geothermal: Saudi Arabia is home to at least 10 hot springs suitable for geothermal power generation. They are mainly found in the country's western region.  Al Khouba hot spring is considered the country’s most important potential geothermal resource.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Global experience to power Saudi Arabia’s renewable future</strong></h5>
<p>In response to this changing landscape of energy challenges and opportunities, Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the country’s leading diversified mutilnationals, established Abdul Latif Jameel Energy in 2012, to support the Saudi Government in achieving its vision for a more sustainable future meeting the country’s energy needs.</p>
<p>Through its solar and wind energy developer, FRV, which it acquired in 2015, Riyadh-based Abdul Latif Jameel Energy has gained over ten years of proven international capability in renewables from developing to mature renewables markets.  It has a 4.8GW development portfolio in solar markets across the Middle East, Australia, Africa, and Latin America – enough to supply electricity to approximately 2.2 million homes and remove more than six million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>As the Saudi Government’s plans for renewables start to come to fruition, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy is ideally positioned to transfer its renewable energy experience to its home market, upskilling the population and taking advantage of the hard-won expertise it has gained through developing renewable energy projects across the world to offer a significant ‘fast-start’ in delivering the country’s vision.</p>
<p>Omar Al-Madhi said: <em>“As an organisation, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy is in an advantageous position.  We have the international know-how for solar and wind development because we have developed projects outside Saudi Arabia, extending as far as Uruguay in the west and Australia in the east.  That allows us to use our experience to benchmark against best practices that are applied in different markets.</em></p>
<p><em>“What also truly differentiates us against other developers is that we’re a truly Saudi-centric organisation; Saudi Arabia is our home, this is where we began, and this is where we have built a reputation for operational excellence and outstanding customer service.  When you combine our international experience, technical know-how and the values of Abdul Latif Jameel, you have a great formula for success.”</em></p>
<p>Capitalising on its expertise in solar and wind power, in January 2017, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy announced the establishment of Almar Water Solutions.  This leading-edge water developer and services provider specialises in water infrastructure development, addressing the water security needs of growing populations through a sustainable program of desalination, water and waste water treatment, and recycling and reuse initiatives.</p>
<p>Almar Water Solutions has already begun to explore co-located development of renewable power generation and reverse osmosis desalination to minimize the carbon footprint of the desalination process.</p>
<h5><strong>Experience where it matters</strong></h5>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel Energy’s expertise in the renewable energy sector is demonstrated by many landmark projects around the world.</p>
<p>Through FRV, it developed Uruguay’s first large-scale solar power plant, La Jacinta<em>.  </em>A key part of the Uruguayan government’s policy to promote solar power, La Jacinta is one of the largest solar PV projects in Latin America.  It supplies 64MW of power to the state-owned electricity company and its impact is considerable.  Approximately 35,000 Uruguayan homes are now powered entirely by the solar energy harnessed at La Jacinta, while almost 75,000 tons of annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions have been eliminated.</p>
<p>The company is also supporting Jordan’s program of renewable energy expansion, fully developing two 65MW solar PV power plants in Mafraq and co-developing a third.  The first plant, which is due to start operations in 2017, will represent one percent of Jordan’s overall generation capacity and power more than 40,000 homes in the country.  The carbon emissions it eliminates will be equivalent to removing approximately 17,000 cars from Jordan’s roads.</p>
<p>In Australia, another landmark FRV project is Moree Solar Farm in New South Wales, which comprises 223,000 tracking solar PV modules and generates enough energy to supply roughly 24,000 homes.  The project also provides a further example of the technological innovation that Abdul Latif Jameel Energy can bring to Saudi Arabia, with Moree Solar Farm being the first large-scale Australian solar project to use a single-axis tracking system.  This system guarantees maximum efficiency in solar energy production by ensuring the PV modules follow the sun’s path from east to west as the day progresses.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel Energy’s track record for innovation is not confined to <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/solar-power-solutions/"">solar energy</a>.   Almar Water Solutions has pre-qualified for a number of major water projects across the MENAT region, including flagship projects at King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) in Saudi Arabia and with the Federal Electricity and Water Authority (FEWA) in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<h5><strong>Making it work in MENAT</strong></h5>
<p>By leveraging the potential knowledge transfer available from Abdul Latif Jameel Energy’s experiences around the world, Saudi Arabia can cement a strong position in an ever-changing energy sector and continue to make strides in its bid to meet the ambitions laid out in <em>Vision 2030</em>.</p>
<p>The company has built-up a globally-proven skillset from both mature and developing renewable energy markets.  Now, it is ideally placed to bring the best knowledge and experience from around the world to help drive the growth and development of Saudi Arabia’s renewable energy sector.</p>
<p><img class=""alignleft"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/03/Omar-Al-Madhi-Senior-Managing-Director-at-Abdul-Latif-Jameel-and-Member-of-the-Board-for-Investment-NEWS.jpg"" alt=""Omar alMadhi Senior Managing Director At Abdul Latif Jameel and Member of the Board for Investment"" /></p>
<p>Omar Al-Madhi says: <em>“What excites me most about the current renewable energy situation in Saudi Arabia, is that we have the opportunity to participate in the development of a significant new area of sustainability for our country.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We firmly believe Saudi Arabia can be a reliable and significant energy supplier to the World in the renewable energy era, just like it has been a reliable global supplier in the hydrocarbon era.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>“We have the fundamental requirements for achieving a leadership role, whether that’s location, an abundance of land, or irradiation numbers. By taking the best of proven technology and expertise from renewables projects across the globe, and combining them with vision, innovation and commitment, the renewable energy sector could be a platform for a more sustainable, more efficient and more secure future for Saudi Arabia.”</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Renewable energy: what are the options?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solar power – </strong>Solar panels turn energy from the sun’s rays into energy.  There are two main types: solar thermal and photovoltaic (PV).  Solar thermal panels use the sun’s energy to heat water.  PV panels turn the sun’s energy directly into electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Wind power</strong> – Generated by using the flow of air through wind turbines to mechanically power generators that create electric power, wind power is clean, uses little land and creates no greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Geothermal power</strong> – By using the heat energy stored in the Earth, geothermal power can be generated with only five percent of the greenhouse gas emissions of traditional coal-fired plants.</p>

12998,Water Scarcity: Turning a regional challenge into a global opportunity,"<h4>For much of 2016, the GCC has been pre-occupied by the economic impact of a liquid that comes out of the ground. Oil has long been the bedrock of regional economies. The revenues generated have built impressive cities, driven investment and modernization, and supported development across the region. However, if the GCC is to continue to grow and progress, there is another liquid to worry about – one far more important to the future of the region: water.</h4>
<h5><strong>Matching Demand and Distribution</strong></h5>
<p>Water is fundamental to life, but ensuring a stable, sustainable supply remains a considerable challenge. Despite there being enough freshwater on Earth to support seven billion people an increasing number of regions are chronically short of water, due largely to its uneven distribution. The problem is exacerbated by hugely inefficient consumption patterns, with vast volumes of water wasted, polluted or unsustainably managed. Indeed, over the last century water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of population increase.]</p>
<p>In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) – the world’s driest region – the problems are even more acute. More than half of the region’s population live under conditions of ‘water stress’, where demand outstrips supply. Although this is perhaps not surprising in an area containing 12 of the world’s most water-scarce countries, the scale of the difference between supply and demand is alarming.</p>
<p>According to World Bank data, the MENA region contains 6 percent of the global population, but less than 2 percent of the world’s renewable water supply. It is not uncommon for the region’s countries to generate renewable water per capita of less than 1,000 m<sup>3</sup> per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Research published by NASA and the University of California Irvine in 2013, revealed how the Middle East dramatically depleted its freshwater reserves between 2003 and 2009. During this seven-year period, the volume of the region’s freshwater reserves decreased by 143.6 cubic kilometers – among the largest liquid freshwater losses on the planet during this period and equivalent to almost the entire volume of the Dead Sea. In the UAE alone, the water table has dropped by around 1 metre per year over the last 30 years, and the country is projected to run out of natural freshwater resources in about 50 years.</p>
<h5><strong>Consumption out of Control</strong></h5>
<p>These rapidly declining water reserves would be a serious challenge even if demand was contained. However, if we consider consumption the Middle East also has some of the world’s highest rates of water consumption. Bahrain, for example, uses 220 percent of its available renewable water reserves every year, but this figure rises to 2,465 percent of renewable reserves in Kuwait. In Saudi Arabia, the figure is 943 percent, with research from King Saud University estimating Saudi Arabia’s daily average per capita consumption at 265 liters.</p>
<p>Water consumption is most significant in the agricultural sector, which frequently accounts for 80 percent of annual demand in the region. There are other factors at play, too. The growth in industrial use of water is tightening the squeeze, while urbanization and improving lifestyles continue to drive high water consumption among citizens going about their normal activities. Everyday tasks such as gardening and car washing are using considerable water resources.</p>
<p>The overall prognosis is not good, and it is getting worse. With the pressure on water supply set to increase yet further as population growth and the effects of global climate change take their toll, water availability per capita in the MENA region is expected to halve by 2050.</p>
<h5><strong>Commercial Impact of Water Scarcity</strong></h5>
<p>Water scarcity does not only have a societal impact, it also has a considerable commercial impact. It is one which is likely to increase and intensify if action is not taken.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, water scarcity could cost some regions up to 6 percent of their GDP over the next 30 years. It is also set to be a major driving force behind migration, increased food prices, and possible conflict.</p>
<p>The United Nations echoes these concerns. In its World Water Development Report 2016, it highlights its belief that reduced water availability will “affect regional water, energy and food security, and potentially geopolitical security”. It also cites threats to economic activity and the job market, as well as highlighting that “the right to safe drinking water and sanitation is an internationally recognized human right… integral to the realization of other human rights”.</p>
<p><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-9034"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/05/FA06-Water-Scarcity-Effects-On-GDP.jpg"" alt=""fa06-water-scarcity-effects-on-gdp"" width=""752"" height=""963"" /></p>
<h5><strong>A Huge Challenge – An Even Greater Opportunity</strong></h5>
<p>Producing enough water to support the Middle East’s growing population needs huge investment in water production facilities and infrastructure, as well as the energy these processes demand.</p>
<p>For more than 50 years, many regional markets have relied on desalination. Around 70 percent of the world’s current desalination capacity is in the Middle East, and it is growing. Saudi Arabia, for example, has earmarked US$ 24.3 billion of investment by 2020 to expand its desalination capacity.</p>
<p>However, the current desalination approach to water generation is simply not sustainable. It is energy intensive, relies on abundant oil, and comes at enormous environmental cost. Desalination plants worldwide emit an estimated 76 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. This is the equivalent of a country the size of Romania and, without substantial changes, it is expected to treble by 2040.</p>
<p>Finding a more sustainable approach to clean water production is therefore essential. This is not only a considerable challenge – but also a huge opportunity. Research from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) suggests that only 1 percent of the world’s desalinated water is currently based on energy from renewable sources – an indication of the massive commercial potential for the GCC to become a world leader in this innovative technology.</p>
<h5><strong>Renewable Water: An Affordable Reality?</strong></h5>
<p>According to the International Desalination Association, the demand for desalinated water is growing by 8 percent each year. The cost of ‘traditional’ desalination is already affordable for middle-income regions and countries. The ongoing use of fossil fuels to provide the energy necessary to power traditional desalination plants, however, is simply replacing one environmental problem with another.</p>
<p>Instead, the focus must be on desalination powered by renewable energy. Some forward-looking global markets are already taking action in this regard. In Western Australia, for example, the state government requires all new desalination plants to use renewable energy – with the result that the Perth Seawater Desalination Plant (SWRO) is powered by electricity generated by a wind farm north of Perth.</p>
<p>As the costs associated with renewable technologies continue to decrease, further advances in the technologies used both for generating renewable energy and the process of desalination will combine to make renewable desalination much more accessible.</p>
<p>New technologies – including pre-treatment processes, nano-technology filtering processes, and electrochemical desalination – are also making desalination more efficient. They are still at the early stages of development, however. We must push forward both their progress and the advancement of renewable technologies suited to desalination, such as solar thermal, solar photovoltaics (PV), wind, and geothermal energy. When those advances are harnessed together, we can make a real impact on the availability of renewable water not only in the Middle East, but across the globe.</p>
<p>The UAE has already recognized the potential of these commercial opportunities. Last year, during Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, an agency of the Abu Dhabi government was instrumental in launching an initiative to explore ways to reduce the carbon footprint of desalination. It was also a key player in the launch of the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance (GCWDA).</p>
<p>There are already reasons to be encouraged. In just five years, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy has become the largest GCC-based solar energy developer and one of the world’s leading solar energy solutions developers. It has invested and grown to develop a global and diversified renewable energy offering, with a presence in more than 15 countries.</p>
<p>This success story, and others like it, can help transform the water industry, too, a sector where <a href=""/en/energy-and-environmental-services/energy-overview/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Abdul Latif Jameel Energy </a>is actively expanding its capabilities in the drive to create more sustainable water production that meets the population’s needs.</p>
<h5><strong>A Combined Approach</strong></h5>
<p>While desalination based on renewable energy is a clear route forward, this transformation cannot be done in isolation. There remains a need to continuously develop new and innovative approaches to confront the world’s water challenge, with governments, industry, science and society all playing their part.</p>
<p>Efficiency must be one pillar in this strategy. Heavily-subsidized water rates across the GCC have created a culture where water is recklessly wasted. Increases in water tariffs are being advocated in Abu Dhabi, while the Environmental Agency Abu Dhabi (EAD) has also installed flow restrictors in 55,000 households and 5,000 public buildings. A combination of practical and policy measures need to be fully considered in all countries facing ‘water stress’.</p>
<p>Scientific development is also key. Fostering partnerships between industry and academia, through initiatives such as the Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security <a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">(J-WAFS) Lab</a> at MIT, is crucial to help translate pioneering research into practical solutions for communities around the world.</p>
<p>More than US$ 2 million was invested through J-WAFS Solutions in 2016 alone. Seed grant funding of US$ 1.3 million was awarded in May 2016, followed by five further grants of US$ 150,000 each in August 2016. There are currently 17 active J-WAFS projects addressing issues ranging from electro-chemical separation process for contaminated water, to using fungal yeasts to convert waste to food. Every cent of that money is helping to tackle the major problems facing mankind over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>Governments, too, must be active in confronting a shared and pressing problem. The Middle East is already making good progress in this area. Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 national development strategy is explicit in recognizing the importance of water scarcity, committing the country to promoting “the optimal use of our water resources by reducing consumption and utilizing treated and renewable water”. It adds: “… the use of water in agriculture will be prioritized for those areas with natural and renewable water sources. We will also continue to collaborate with consumers, food manufacturers and distributors to reduce any resource wastage.”</p>
<p>At a regional level, the GCC is exploring the possibility of a cross-border water grid to enable water to be moved from areas of relative oversupply to those facing shortages. Sustainable ‘smart’ cities, at the heart of development strategies across the region, will also help communities understand and manage water consumption like never before.</p>
<h5><strong>Global Progress</strong></h5>
<p>Although there are encouraging signs across the GCC, water scarcity is a global issue and technological progress is being made around the world. It is up to GCC countries not only to keep the pace but to lead it.</p>
<p>Commercial opportunities are certainly available, as evidenced by Singapore’s successful development of NEWater – a high-grade reclaimed water process that now forms a key part of the country’s water sustainability strategy. Since 2000, treated used water has gone through a three-step process, built on advanced membrane technologies, that results in ultra-clean reclaimed water. It currently provides 30 percent of Singapore’s water needs, and is expected to serve 55 percent of the nation’s demand by 2060.</p>
<p>Similarly, in 2014 the Alto da Boa Vista drinking water plant in São Paulo, Brazil, installed and launched the first ultrafiltration drinking water system in South America. The system uses high-flow membranes from Koch Membrane Systems Inc. to double the treatment capacity of the plant and enable it to handle the high algae content of water drawn from the local reservoir and clarifiers during the dry season.</p>
<p>In Baja California Sur, Mexico, Sisyan LLC is investing in photovoltaic reverse osmosis plants that provide renewable desalination. And in Melbourne, Australia, a 600 m<sup>3</sup>/day sewer-mining scheme delivered by Arup provides recycled water to three sporting venues – “making use of water that would otherwise be flushed away”.</p>
<h5><strong>It’s Time to Act</strong></h5>
<p>The MENAT region cannot afford to be left behind by such initiatives to combat water scarcity. We have the skills and knowledge to be a global pioneer in this exciting field and benefit from the huge commercial opportunities it presents. Underlining our own commitment to becoming a global leader in the water solutions sector, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy announced the expansion of its capabilities with the establishment of Almar Water Solutions at the World Future Energy Summit 2017 held in Abu Dhabi in January. Almar Water Solutions, a provider of specialist expertise in water infrastructure development addressing the water security needs of our region’s and the world’s growing population through a sustainable program of desalination, water and waste water treatment and recycling and reuse initiatives. We are also exploring co-located development of renewable power generation and reverse osmosis desalination together to minimize the energy used in production and the carbon footprint of the desalination process. With an initial focus on water projects in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, the team has proven experience in numerous international markets. Already, Almar Water Solutions is being considered for major infrastructure projects across the MENAT region, having recently pre-qualified for flagship opportunities, including those at King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) in Saudi Arabia and with the Federal Electricity and Water Authority (FEWA) in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2030, desalination capacity across the MENA region is predicted to expand from 21 million m<sup>3</sup> per day to almost 110 million m<sup>3</sup> per day. In turn, that will triple electricity demand for desalination to 122 TWh by 2030. So, the potential available to those who can lead the development of renewable desalination is clear.</p>
<p>However, it is imperative that further rapid progress is made. By meeting the water challenge head on, and encouraging investment, innovation and partnerships across society, the GCC can put itself at the forefront of a fast-growing, innovative industry that will become increasingly vital to global development in the coming years.</p>",https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2017/05/alj-turning-regional-challenge-into-global-opportunity.jpg,1494374400,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",0,202,,Water Scarcity: regional challenge to global opportunity,"<p>For much of 2016, the GCC has been pre-occupied by the economic impact of a liquid that comes out of the ground.

<h5><strong>Natural Potential</strong></h5>
<p>Independent sources such as Moody’s Investors Service have highlighted the country’s <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/energy-overview/"">renewable energy</a> market as a key growth opportunity: its “abundant solar resource, land availability and A-rated sovereign credit” make it ideally suited to become a world leader in renewable electricity generation<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Although global progress so far has been relatively modest, despite the falling production costs of renewable energy, Saudi Arabia is blessed with enviable conditions that could enable it to secure a pivotal status in future energy markets.</p>
<p>Omar Al-Madhi, Abdul Latif Jameel Energy CEO, Saudi Arabia, said: <em>“As a nation we are well-endowed with vast stretches of flat land, which is ideal for incorporating solar plants.  </em><em>We are one of the highest solar radiation locations on Earth and we have, to a certain degree, the other necessary elements as far as </em>[power distribution]<em> network connectivity is concerned.”</em></p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s solar power potential is enormous.  It lies in the ‘Global Sunbelt’, a geographic region situated between 35°N and 35°S and generally characterized by high solar irradiation<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a>.  Its solar irradiances are among the highest in the world<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a>, with annual average daily global horizontal irradiance (GHI) measured at 5700 Wh/m<sup>2</sup> to 6700 Wh/m<sup>2 <a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Indeed, more than 59 percent of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s (GCC) surface area <em>“has significant potential for solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment.  Developing just 1 percent of this area can potentially result in 470GW of solar PV capacity,”</em><a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</a> according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).</p>
<p><img class=""wp-image-9420"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/05/Sunbelt-Mapping-Saudi-Arabia.png"" alt=""Sunbelt Mapping Sadui Arabia"" width=""971"" height=""594"" /></p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is equally blessed in terms of its wind energy resources, too.  Three regions of the country are particularly suitable for generating wind energy.  Average wind speeds in the northeast, central and mountainous regions to the west are all 33 percent above the levels needed for <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/wind-power-solutions/"">wind energy</a> to become economically viable.</p>
<p>“There’s already been a pilot project by Saudi Aramco where they have installed a wind generation turbine,” says Mr. Al-Madhi.  “That will hopefully create a good example for the rest of the country to follow.”</p>
<p>Indeed, economic and environmental factors that benefit renewable energies are aligning across the GCC.  According to IRENA<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>, “the abundance of solar resource potential and the falling cost of associated technologies, mainly photovoltaic (PV) modules, are major factors influencing the attractiveness of solar energy in the region.  Solar PV modules, for instance, cost three quarters less today than in 2009 and will continue to decrease.”</p>
<p>IRENA has also highlighted encouraging developments in the provision of wind energy.  “Globally, onshore wind costs have been declining, making it one of the most competitive sources of electricity available in wind-rich countries.”</p>
<p>However, while new technologies such as wind and solar power generation have grown, they have done so from a small base and there is still much work to do globally.  The latest Global Tracking Framework report produced by the World Bank and the International Energy Agency<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"">[7]</a>, for example, says more significant steps are needed if global renewable energy targets are to be reached.  It argues that large, energy-intensive industries – such as heating and transport sectors – must now be encouraged to develop greater use of renewable energies.</p>
<h5><strong>Government Support</strong></h5>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s government is backing the process of energy diversification, with its comprehensive <em>Vision 2030</em><a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</a> national development strategy emphasizing the country’s commitment to a cleaner future.  It is targeting 3.45GW of renewable energy by 2020, 9.5GW by 2023, and 54GW (41GW solar, 9GW wind, 3GW waste-to-energy and 1GW geothermal) by 2040<a href=""#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"">[9]</a>.  <em>Vision 2030</em> states:</p>
<p><img class=""size-full wp-image-6550 alignleft"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/04/alj-saudi-arabia-vision-2030.png"" alt=""Saudi Arabia Vision 2030"" width=""200"" height=""134"" /></p>
<p>“Even though we have an impressive natural potential for solar and wind power, and our local energy consumption will increase three-fold by 2030, we still lack a competitive renewable energy sector at present.To build up the sector, we have set ourselves an initial target of generating 9.5 gigawatts of renewable energy.  We will also seek to localize a significant portion of the renewable energy value chain in the Saudi economy, including research and development, and manufacturing . . .”</p>
<p>The government is also taking firm steps to ensure that the positive words of <em>Vision 2030</em> are carried through into positive actions.  In <em>Vision 2030</em>, the government pledges to <em>“review the legal and regulatory framework”</em> around the private sector investing in renewables; <em>“localize the industry”</em> by encouraging public-private partnerships; and ensure the competitiveness of renewable energy through <em>“the gradual liberalization of the fuels market”</em>.</p>
<p><img class=""wp-image-9428 aligncenter"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/05/REPDO-Logo.png"" alt=""REPDO Logo"" width=""547"" height=""152"" /></p>
<p>It has also set up a Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO) within the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, which aims to ensure renewable energy growth matches the ambitions laid out in <em>Vision 2030</em>.</p>
<p>It is aided in this role by the National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) and the National Transformation Program (NTP), which are both working to ensure the country meets the target of 9.5GW of renewable energy by 2023.</p>
<p><img class=""alignright  wp-image-9427"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/05/Khalid-A-Al-Falih-Minister-of-Energy-Industry-Mineral-Resources.jpg"" alt=""Khalid A Al-Falih-Minister of Energy Industry Mineral Resources"" width=""240"" height=""180"" />In February 2017, Saudi Arabia launched its first request for qualifications (RFQs) for round one of the NREP – which is run by REPDO.  Khalid A. Al-Falih Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources said: <em>“It is our goal to make the National Renewable Energy Program among the most attractive, competitive and well executed government renewable energy investment programs in the world, and we have all the necessary infrastructure in place to ensure that is the case.”</em><a href=""#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"">[10]</a></p>
<p>The NTP, meanwhile, is hailed as <em>“a key part of a blueprint to prepare the kingdom for the post-oil era”</em>.  Its objectives include ensuring 4 percent of Saudi Arabia’s total energy use comes from renewables by 2020, and that almost 7,800 jobs are supplied by the atomic and renewable energy sectors in the same timeframe<a href=""#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"">[11]</a>.</p>
<p>Those targets look eminently achievable.  In April 2017, the government announced it will offer as much as 1 GW of contracts to buy renewable electricity by the end of 2017<a href=""#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"">[12]</a>.  It will auction power-purchase agreements covering 620 megawatts of photovoltaic installations and 400 megawatts for wind farms in its second round of tenders for the technologies, according to Turki al-Shehri, head of renewable energy project development at the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources.</p>
<h5><strong>Working to Advance Saudi Arabia and its People</strong></h5>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel continues to work tirelessly to support the Saudi government in achieving its vision for renewable energy in the country.  It formed Abdul Latif Jameel Energy in 2012, and since then has been harnessing global best practice in a bid to develop increasingly efficient and cost-effective renewable energy solutions.  Its efforts are designed to ensure the country meets its specific renewable energy targets for 2020, 2023 and 2040, and that Saudi Arabia’s citizens enjoy ever more prosperous and enhanced standards of living.</p>
<p><img class=""alignleft wp-image-5522"" src=""https://alj.com/app/uploads/2017/03/Omar-Al-Madhi-Senior-Managing-Director-at-Abdul-Latif-Jameel-and-Member-of-the-Board-for-Investment-NEWS.jpg"" alt=""Omar Al-Madhi"" width=""239"" height=""166"" /></p>
<p>Mr. Al-Madhi said: <em>“As an organization, we are in an advantageous position.  We have the international know-how needed for solar and wind development because we’ve developed projects outside the boundaries of Saudi Arabia, extending as far as Uruguay in the west and Australia in the east. </em></p>
<p><em>That allows us to benchmark against the best practices applied in different countries.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But above all, we are a Saudi-centric organization; this is where we began and this is where we have built up a strong brand, based on excellent customer service and the ability to deliver operationally.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The combination of our international experience, technical know-how and in-depth knowledge of Saudi Arabia means we can bring a range of benefits to the country.  These include, creating new jobs, transferring know-how to the local population and localizing services such as Operation and Maintenance and Asset Management used for our projects.”</em></p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel Energy is doing everything it can to help deliver a cleaner future for its home country.  Mr. Al-Madhi was among the attendees at the inaugural Saudi Arabia Renewable Energy Investment Forum (SAREIF) in April 2017.  The event, which was staged in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, saw industry leaders gather to explore the opportunities afforded by the country’s vast renewable energy potential.</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Madhi said: <em>“I firmly believe that Saudi Arabia can be a reliable, global and very significant energy supplier to the world in a renewable energy era, just like it has been in the hydrocarbon era.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We have all the fundamental requirements for achieving a leadership role, whether that’s location, an abundance of land, or irradiation numbers.  The renewable energy sector could be a platform for us stretch beyond meeting our local requirements and continue to supply energy to the whole world.”</em></p>

13001,Building Saudi Arabia's Future Communities,"<h4>Across Saudi Arabia and the wider MENA region, one challenge to socio-economic development is the increasing demand for suitable housing from middle-income earners.  A family space of their own is a key aspiration of the region’s young, connected and increasingly global population, to fulfil their ambitions for personal independence.</h4>
<p>In 2011, research suggested there was a demand for an additional of 3.5 million middle-income homes across the MENA region<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>.  In Saudi Arabia, the figure was estimated to be around 400,000, with the rising population and urbanization pushing this figure ever higher.</p>
<p>To address this demand, some 3.3 million new housing units will need to be built by 2025, according to the Ministry of Housing, with population projections reaching 37 million over the same period.</p>
<p>This will entail a significant increase in the rate of supply compared with previous decades, where only half that number of homes came to market, hindered by longer-term constraints such as the rising cost of land and high costs of construction at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Defining middle-income housing</strong></p>
<p>Middle-income housing is defined as housing that can be secured for no more than 30 percent of the gross household income of the middle 40-60 percent of households on the income distribution scale<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the Saudi Arabian population now earns between 6,000 and 20,000 Saudi Riyals per month (approximately US$ 1,600 to 5,000), yet just 30 percent of these own their own homes, compared to a worldwide average of 70 percent<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>The Saudi Arabian government recognized this unsatisfied demand early, and began addressing the situation in 2011. Today, its <em>Vision 2030</em> strategy outlines how it will coordinate three aims – an ambitious nation, a thriving economy, and a vibrant society – to energize growth in the housing market.</p>
<p><em><img class=""size-full wp-image-1082 alignleft"" src=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alj-saudi-arabia-vision-2030.png"" sizes=""(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"" srcset=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alj-saudi-arabia-vision-2030.png 200w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/alj-saudi-arabia-vision-2030-179x120.png 179w"" alt="""" />“We recognize each family’s aspiration to own a home and the important role home ownership plays in strengthening family security.  Even though 47 percent of Saudi families already own their homes, we aim to increase this rate by five percentage points by 2020 . . .    We will meet this target by introducing a number of laws and regulations; encouraging the private sector to build houses; and providing funding, mortgage solutions and ownership schemes that meet the needs of our citizens.”</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building affordable homes</strong></p>
<p>Providing affordable homes for Saudis, however, is not a task the government can be expected to meet alone.  Saudi Arabia’s construction sector must become more active in reshaping itself and tackling these challenges.  There are also opportunities to increase the awareness of energy-saving materials; develop a greater focus on after-sales services; and continue to work towards a healthy balance between property size and quality.</p>
<p>However, even if these issues are addressed, the key problem of supply remains: the average Saudi Arabian family finds it difficult to afford to buy its desired home.</p>
<p>In the short-term, there is some relief on the horizon.  The Government Authority for Statistics’ <em>Real Estate Price Index<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4""><strong>[4]</strong></a></em> shows a decrease in domestic real estate prices during the first quarter of 2017 of around 2.3%, over Q4/2016, and a decrease of 9.9% year-over year for the first quarter – but price alone is not the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Government Initiatives to increase accessibility</strong></p>
<p>An emphasis on residential housing has been a keystone of government initiatives for over five years, with a number of regulatory changes aimed at improving the accessibility of real estate.</p>
<p>These include restructuring and recapitalizing the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) to target low income households, and introducing new mortgage regulations to help increase home ownership rates.</p>
<p>While these are creating more momentum, the policies are only slowly filtering through.  The decision in December 2014, to set the loan-to-value ratio at 70 percent also had an unintended impact on middle-income households unable to find the 30 percent down payment.  The aim was to reduce the risk of a property-driven credit bubble, like those seen in some Western markets, but it meant that retail real estate loans grew by only 8 percent in 2015, against 34 percent in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing housing supply</strong></p>
<p>The Saudi Government recognizes that, irrespective of measures to increase demand, market growth is still being held back by an ongoing shortage in supply.</p>
<p>It has therefore introduced several reforms designed to encourage developers – local and foreign – to build 1.5 million homes in the country by 2025.</p>
<p>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) have been introduced to stimulate the market, offering tax benefits to foreign investors that could, according to reports, help “channel additional sources of funding into the development of private-sector schemes across the Kingdom”<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>In 2016, the mortgage regulations were loosened, and the requirement for a minimum 30 percent down-payments was halved to 15 percent, meaning that homebuyers could now secure loans for up to 85 percent of a property’s value<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>The remit of the Real Estate Development Fund (REDF) has also been widened, so it is now the largest financier for the real estate sector, with a portfolio of approximately 190 billion Saudi Riyals<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7""><sup>[7]</sup></a><sup>.</sup></p>
<p><strong>Impact of ‘White Land’ Tax</strong></p>
<p>The introduction of the White Land Tax in March 2017, is a further positive development expected to help reduce the shortfall in supply of middle-income housing.</p>
<p><em>‘White Land’</em> is open land not designated for development and, according to research by consultants Ernst &amp; Young (EY), it is <em>“seen as a major contributor to a growing housing shortage”</em><a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>With up to 50 percent of the land inside Saudi Arabia’s major cities remaining vacant, and much of it owned by wealthy individuals or companies<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"">[9]</a>, the White Land Tax is a way of encouraging active investment and housing development, while discouraging land hoarding, with the government promising to impose fees on undeveloped plots in urban areas.</p>
<p>Under the tax, landowners will pay 2.5 percent of the value of their non-income generating undeveloped land each year, as an incentive for them to develop the land themselves, or release the land for development<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"">[10]</a>.</p>
<p>The introduction of the White Land Tax will also generate additional revenue for the exchequer and increase “the overall real estate transactions by value and numbers”<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"">[11]</a>.  As much as 40 per cent of the capital, Riyadh, has been identified as liable for the tax, which economists have estimated could raise up to US$ 15 billion a year, reported a recent <em>Financial Times</em> article<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/building-saudi-arabias-future-communities/#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"">[12]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A changing country</strong></p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel has long recognized the challenges facing Saudi Arabia’s real estate sector, together with the opportunity they bring, and is committed to playing a significant role as the country shapes itself for the future.</p>
<p>In 2013, it set up a dedicated real estate arm, <a href=""https://aljland.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Abdul Latif Jameel Land</a>, to help drive innovation and expansion in the market. Its first residential project – the J│ONE development in Jeddah (<a href=""http://www.joneresidence.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">www.joneresidence.com</a>) – is an inspiring model for the future of affordable housing across the country.</p>
<p>Located in the vibrant Al Salamah area in the north west of the city, J│ONE</p>
<p><img class=""size-full wp-image-1141 aligncenter"" src=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/J-One-Front-Artistic-View.jpg"" sizes=""(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px"" srcset=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/J-One-Front-Artistic-View.jpg 752w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/J-One-Front-Artistic-View-300x138.jpg 300w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/J-One-Front-Artistic-View-179x83.jpg 179w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/J-One-Front-Artistic-View-374x173.jpg 374w"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>features 242 new apartments, ranging from one to four-bedrooms and floor areas between 80m<sup>2</sup> and 220m<sup>2</sup>.  Its five stories of living space give residents easy access to Jeddah’s business district, while also providing amenities including a fitness center, swimming pool, retail facilities and play areas for children.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fady Jameel, President of Abdul Latif Jameel International, says<em>:</em><em> “With </em>J│ONE<em>, and all our future residential projects, our aim is to build on our 70 years of real estate expertise to develop a new community that suits the evolving needs of the Saudi market, for both lower and middle-income sectors.  From the location, to the use of material and the correct use of space, this project will stand out in the city.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In recognition of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 aims of increasing renewable energy consumption, the apartments will be powered by solar panels.  In addition, Abdul Latif Jameel’s own finance provider can help purchasers arrange mortgage finance for their property – helping to ease one of the key stumbling blocks for those seeking to buy middle-income properties.</p>
<p><em><img class="" wp-image-1140 alignleft"" src=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fady-M-Jameel-1.jpg"" sizes=""(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px"" srcset=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fady-M-Jameel-1.jpg 280w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fady-M-Jameel-1-223x300.jpg 223w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fady-M-Jameel-1-126x170.jpg 126w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fady-M-Jameel-1-264x356.jpg 264w"" alt="""" width=""212"" height=""285"" />“We’re enormously proud of </em>J│ONE<em> and we’re immensely grateful to the municipality, whose help and support have been vital in making the project a reality.  We want customers to know that if they do buy a property from Abdul Latif Jameel Land, they are buying not just a quality place to live: they are buying into an investment that will remain for the next 20 or 30 years . . .”<br />
</em> Mr. Jameel concludes.</p>
<p>In developing J│ONE, Abdul Latif Jameel Land is already attracting interest from young Saudis looking to move onto the housing ladder.</p>
<p>It has a pipeline of further residential developments already in planning, with the aim of bringing at least one new residential community to the market every year from 2018, to 2023.</p>
<p>With its relentless focus on investing in Saudi Arabia’s future communities, Abdul Latif Jameel Land is showing that by tapping into the resources, knowledge and talent available across the country, by listening to the demands of the population, and by working closely with government at all levels, Saudi Arabia’s middle-income housing market could be on the threshold of a brighter future.</p>

<p>Both businesses and individuals benefit from the country’s competitive tax regime.  Among the common forms of taxation absent in Saudi Arabia are income tax, sales tax, and property tax (although not currently present, Value Added Tax (VAT) is planned for implementation in 2018 across the GCC, including in Saudi Arabia).  Tax exemptions are available on earnings from exports, while tax credits apply on research and development investments.  For overseas investors, there is further good news, with a relatively low 20 percent corporate tax on total profits from companies and 5% withholding tax, but any losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxes<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>At the enviously strategic geographic position as a cross-road between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent, Saudi Arabia’s infrastructure and transport links are well-established, while an increasingly young population has been a key factor in many of the government’s strategic decisions.  Saudi Arabia was among the first countries to license 3G services (2004) and 4G services (2011), and by early 2015 the mobile phone penetration rate was 167.5 percent – with almost 52 million subscriptions across the country<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"">[7]</a>.  The rapid urbanization of Saudi Arabia’s citizens has fueled expansion of urban transport systems, while the country’s three main airports – in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam – continue to serve growing numbers of air passengers and freight.</p>

<p>In 1997, it was a founding member of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA).  Eight years later, Saudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization.  It has also signed bilateral trade and investment treaties with countries across Europe and Asia.  Furthermore, as a founding member of the GCC, it was also crucial to the introduction of the GCC Customs Union in 2003.  This agreement eliminated internal tariffs and enabled the free movement of labor and capital within member countries<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory incentives for Foreign Direct Investment</strong></p>
<p>The Saudi government has made no secret of its desire to attract |Foreign Direct Investment, which is regarded as one of the most effective ways to diversify the economy and provide employment for future generations.  Indeed, the nation’s strategic development plan, <em>Vision 2030</em>, sets out the country’s ambition to increase Foreign Direct Investment from 3.8 percent of GDP to the international benchmark level of 5.7 percent of GDP by 2030<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>In the <em>National Transformation Program (NTP)</em>, which outlines interim targets up to 2020<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"">[10]</a>, Saudi Arabia outlines its aim to increase Foreign Direct Investment from SAR 30 billion (US$ 8 bn) to SAR 70 billion (US$ 18.6 bn).  This goal is reinforced by the ambitions of <em>Vision 2030</em>, which outlines the country’s “determination to become a global investment powerhouse”.  Vision 2030 goes on to state that Saudi Arabia will:</p>
<p><em><img class=""size-full wp-image-1034 alignleft"" src=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Vision_2030_Logo.png"" sizes=""(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px"" srcset=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Vision_2030_Logo.png 288w, https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Vision_2030_Logo-179x108.png 179w"" alt="""" />“… Develop our investment tools to unlock our promising economic sectors, diversify our economy and create job opportunities.  We will also grow our economy and improve the quality of our services, by privatizing some government services, improving the business environment, attracting the finest talent and the best investments globally, and leveraging our unique strategic location in connecting three continents.”</em></p>
<p>As such, the Saudi government has taken several steps to attract foreign investors to the country – primarily through its Foreign Investment Law of 2000 and the subsequent establishment of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (<a href=""https://www.sagia.gov.sa/en/Pages/default.aspx"">SAGIA</a>).</p>

It aims <em>“to help attract investments to serve the development goals and participate in the diversification of the Saudi economy.”</em><a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"">[11]</a> It is responsible for issuing investment licenses, with business registration and set-up now occurring within 30 days of submission to SAGIA<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"">[12]</a>.</p>
<p>Foreign investors can also access a range of financial programs, including: the <a href=""http://www.amf.org.ae/en"">Arab Monetary Fund</a>, which promotes the development of Arab financial markets and trade among member states<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"">[13]</a>; the <a href=""http://www.arabfund.org/"">Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development</a> (AFESD), which finances social development and economic projects across the Middle East; and the <a href=""http://www.atfp.org.ae/"">Arab Trade Financing Program</a>, which offers medium- and long-term loans to boost trade.  There is also funding for industrial projects through the <a href=""http://www.sidf.gov.sa/en/pages/default.aspx"">Saudi Industrial Development Fund</a> (SIDF) as well as other government and commercial bank funding mechanisms.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia also relaxed some of its foreign ownership and investment regulations in May 2016<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn14"" name=""_ftnref14"">[14]</a>, with a view to encouraging the participation of international institutional investors in its privatization program.</p>
<p><strong>Forging strong business links around the world</strong></p>
<p>In addition to its practical legislative changes and insightful strategic policies, Saudi Arabia’s determination to spread its message led to the country’s involvement in several high-profile international trade and diplomatic initiatives during spring 2017.</p>
<p>One prime example of this is the visit by King Salman with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo.</p>

<p>The combination of regulatory reforms and diplomatic efforts appears to be bearing significant fruit elsewhere, too. In February 2017, PepsiCo indicated its confidence in Saudi Arabia’s future by unveiling plans to open a significant manufacturing plant in Jeddah.  It will initially supply the entire Gulf region, before expanding further in future years.  Sanjeev Chadha, CEO of PepsiCo in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, said: <em>“The plant is going to be one of the largest in the PepsiCo system globally.”</em><a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn17"" name=""_ftnref17"">[17]</a></p>
<p>Global electronics giant Sony is also aiming to grow its presence across the Middle East and Africa.  It aims to increase business by 20 percent in 2017 through a combination of new product launches and a refreshed business strategy<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/saudi-arabia-attractive-fast-growing-destination-foreign-direct-investment/#_ftn18"" name=""_ftnref18"">[18]</a>.</p>

13007,J-WAFS in action: Enabling local fertilizer production in Africa,"<h4>Karthish Manthiram, Warren K. Lewis Career Development Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at MIT, is leading one of seven research projects recently awarded J-WAFS funding.  Karthish aims to develop a solar-powered electrochemical device that can convert nitrogen from air, water and sunlight into ammonia that can be added to soil to promote plant growth.</h4>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel's  quarterly magazine, 'Opening Doors' spoke to Professor Manthiram about the project and its aims.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the title of your research project?</strong></p>
<p>It’s called ‘Electrochemical Nitrogen Fixation for Distributed Fertilizer Production’.</p>
<p><strong>What is the project about?</strong></p>
<p>Low crop yields are a key contributor to malnourishment and poverty in Africa.  At the same time, the use of fertilizers is much lower in Africa compared to other regions of the world, limiting the agricultural productivity of the soil.  This is partly because there are no robust local markets for fertilizers in Africa.  Farming remains largely small-scale and scattered, and the costs of fertilizer distribution are very high due to poor infrastructure.  This situation is not compatible with the highly centralized production of ammonia for fertilizers, which uses the Haber-Bosch process.  This process needs to be conducted at large scales due to the high temperatures and pressures used, which are cost-prohibitive at smaller scales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our research aims to demonstrate a new way to produce ammonia locally, using commonly available feedstocks, and avoid the problems of cost and distribution that have hindered the use of fertilizer in Africa to date.</p>
<p>We propose an electrochemical device, which can be driven using solar panels, to convert nitrogen from air and water to produce ammonia.  Because the device requires only air, water and sunlight, it can be deployed at remote locations.  The ammonia produced can then be directly injected into soil or reacted with carbon dioxide to create urea, which can be easily handled by farmers for local use.</p>
<p>Altogether, the research will help to illuminate whether local, electrochemical generation of fertilizers is a viable method for small communities of farmers to take control of their own soil health.</p>
<p><strong>Why is ammonia so important in the production of fertilizer?</strong></p>
<p>Ammonia is an important source of nitrogen, which is one of the key nutrients that plants need to grow.  When we use fertilizer, we are putting nitrogen back into the soil that has been depleted by previous agricultural use.  Increasing the nutrients in the content of the soil in this way helps to increase the agricultural productivity of the land.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a relatively low level of fertilizer use in Africa?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a combination of infrastructure and resources.  There’s a big need for fertilizer in Africa to improve soil health, but the infrastructure to import, store and distribute fertilizer to areas where it’s most needed just isn’t developed enough.  There is also a lack of resources at an individual level.  Fertilizer can be too costly for individual farmers, even though it can increase their productivity, which helps them to lift themselves out of poverty.  So it becomes a ‘chicken and egg’ problem, with limited local demand meaning that regional governments and the private sector are reluctant to invest in developing the infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Are fertilizers widely used in the Middle East?</strong></p>
<p>The use of fertilizers in the Middle East is more common, and the region has considerable natural potential for fertilizer production.  To produce ammonia, you require hydrogen, and a great source of hydrogen is natural gas, which of course is a mainstay of the Middle East’s economy.  But producing ammonia in this way results in a very large carbon footprint.  Our technology would potentially enable the Middle East to capitalize on the global market for fertilizer, while reducing carbon emissions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“there is no need for centralized infrastructure and it is easier to break the poverty cycle”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can you briefly describe how your proposed device works?</strong></p>
<p>What we’re proposing is a new process to harness clean electricity from domestic solar panels or wind turbines, for example, and combine it with nitrogen and water to create ammonia.  This could be done at an individual level, or even at a village or community level, so there is no need for centralized infrastructure and it is easier to break the poverty cycle.</p>
<p><strong>What would the technology actually produce?  </strong></p>
<p>The technology could produce ammonia or urea, both of which are effective fertilizers. There are two practical ways of doing this.  One method is to make ammonia and then find a way to inject it directly into the soil.  This is what our research will partly be focusing on.  The other is to react the ammonia with CO<sub>2</sub> to make urea, which can then be sold as a solid fertilizer that is easy to handle and distribute.</p>
<p><strong>Given that the technology could be driven by solar or <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/energy-and-environmental-services/wind-power-solutions/"">wind energy</a>, it would seem to be ideally suited to the Middle East and North Africa. Is this the case? </strong></p>
<p>Yes absolutely.  There is a strong commitment from many governments in the region to make the most of their sustainable natural resources like solar and wind, to help improve their societies, and the lives of their citizens</p>
<p>If we can provide a new process to take clean energy and use it to produce fertilizer in a more sustainable way, expanding current markets and pioneering new ones, it could be a very exciting development.</p>
<p><strong>What about the wider environmental impact?</strong></p>
<p>Current methods of ammonia production derive from processes that were invented 100 years ago, which have a big carbon footprint.  Our technology could significantly reduce the carbon footprint of fertilizer production.  A second environmental benefit involves fertilizer run-off.  Traditionally, adding fertilizer to the soil in large amounts means that when it rains, a certain amount of ammonia and other ingredients is lost through run-off discharged into streams and rivers.  Our hope is that by producing fertilizers locally and injecting them into the soil in a much more controlled way, we reduce the run-off problem by delivering only the amount of fertilizer that the crop actually requires.</p>
<p><strong>This latest round of J-WAFS funding will run until August 2019. Do you expect your research to be complete by then? </strong></p>
<p>We are still only at the early stage of this research.  Although we are very positive about the project, there is still some fundamental science to figure out first in order to enable this technological innovation.  There are likely to be further phases of research where we fine tune the technology and find the best way to implement it, so that it has the maximum impact on people’s lives.</p>

13010,J-WAFS in action: Creating food and fuel from algae,"<p>Mathias Kolle, Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, is leading one of seven research projects recently awarded J-WAFS funding.  Mathias aims to tackle the challenges of large-scale microalgae cultivation for food and fuel, and help turn microalgae into a sustainable and energy-efficient option for feeding a growing human population in the future.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel's quarterly magazine, 'Opening Doors',  spoke to Professor Kolle about this fascinating project and its aims.</p>
<p><strong>What is the title of your research project?</strong></p>
<p>The project is called <em>‘Multifunctional Light-Diffusing Fibers for Simultaneous Light Management and Fluid Transport in Microalgae Bioreactors’</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the project about?</strong></p>
<p>The need for food and feedstock for animals will increase dramatically by 2050, by which time the world population is predicted to reach over 9.1 billion. This is a rise of over 25 percent on the current figure, according to United Nations forecasts.  This growing population will need more and more food to survive.  However, research suggests that the growth rate in yields of the major cereal crops that sustain much of the world’s population is declining. Additionally, further intensification of agriculture has severe side effects.  Agriculture is one of the major sources of global warming and puts intense strain on water resources.  Large amounts of water are needed to sustain production, and substantial water pollution results from agricultural run-off, which poses a threat to many ecosystems around the globe.</p>
<p>Recent research into the generation of food, feedstock, and biofuel from microalgae suggests that algae is much more efficient at generating usable organic matter (or ‘biomass’) than ‘traditional’ crops like oil palm, wheat and corn.</p>
<p>This suggests that the cultivation of microalgae could be an important element of future strategies to ensure food and fuel security for the world’s rapidly increasing population.</p>
<p><strong>Could you explain what algae is?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""size-full wp-image-1100 alignleft"" src=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Algea.jpg"" alt="""" />Microalgae is the green ‘goo’ you often see in ponds, lakes, rivers and along the sea shore.  It is made up of small organisms – you can see them very well under the microscope – that are only a couple of micro-meters to several hundred micro-meters across. A micro-meter is a tenth of a millimeter, so that’s pretty small.</p>
<p>Microalgae can grow in virtually any type of water – sea water, fresh water, brackish water.  It tends to grow near the surface, where it has ready access to sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2), but it can extend several meters lower down into the water.</p>
<p><strong>What is the issue you are seeking to address?</strong></p>
<p>Several companies across the world are developing and utilizing algae culturing on an industrial scale for food and fuel, but current methods are not yet economically viable.  Algae grows in water and thrives on light and carbon dioxide. This usually means that algae near the surface of the water – with easier access to light and CO<sub>2</sub> – tends grow better than algae nearer the bottom, where light and CO<sub>2</sub> are scarcer. In order to ensure time-efficient production of high quality algae, the whole culture has to be exposed to light and CO<sub>2</sub>. Presently, the methods used to ensure adequate supply of light and CO<sub>2 </sub>to the entire algae culture require a lot of energy, which significantly increases production costs.</p>
<p><strong>How does your project overcome these challenges?</strong></p>
<p>Our research aims to develop a new method for growing algae on an industrial scale that is economically sustainable and does not require large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>At its core is a new type of optical fiber that will enable us to distribute light and CO<sub>2 </sub>to microalgae cultures more effectively and efficiently.  With the J-WAFS seed funding, we will design, build and test different variations of optical fibers. Our goal is to be able to control the light and CO<sub>2</sub> that is delivered to all the algae.  In simple terms, the fibers will take light and CO<sub>2</sub> from the surface of the water and channel it down to those parts of the algae tank that have less access to light and CO<sub>2</sub>.  We estimate that this method could save around 50 percent or more of the energy currently required.</p>
<p>This simple, energy-efficient means of ensuring homogeneous light distribution and simultaneous delivery of CO<sub>2 </sub>will help industrial algae cultivation reach its full economic and social potential for food, feedstock, and biofuel generation.</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of using algae to produce biomass for fuel, feedstock and food? </strong></p>
<p>Large-scale algae culturing can contribute to food security: algae can produce biomass for nutrition and fuel more efficiently than more common crops like oil palm, wheat and corn.  Consequently, industrial cultivation of algae would not only yield a more efficient production of biofuels, it could also enable the generation of nutrients for food and feedstock.</p>
<p>Although increased industrial interest in the culturing of microalgae in recent years has largely been driven by the prospect of more efficient biofuel production – algae can be 40-times more efficient then land-based oil producing plants – cultivating microalgae for biomass production would also have strong positive effects for food security.</p>
<p>A bigger emphasis on using algae as a source of biomass would enable us to shift biofuel production from agricultural crops to algae aquacultures.  This in turn would mean more land would be available to grow crops for food, rather than fuel, and ultimately ease pressure on food supply and prices.</p>
<p>Another exciting benefit of algae application is that by basing the algae farm near a wastewater treatment plant, the algae can do part of the work of wastewater treatment, because they thrive on the nutrients that are in wastewater.</p>
<p>Algae can also reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions at power plants.  For example, from the smoke stack of a power plant you could channel the flue gases through the algae culture, and the algae will remove the CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p><strong>What could be the implications of this technology for the Middle East and North Africa?</strong></p>
<p>The long hours of sunshine all year round, access to seawater and availability of non-arable land for algae cultivation mean that much of the Middle East has strong potential for producing algae-based biofuels.</p>
<p>The presence of numerous oil refineries and power plants from which CO<sub>2</sub> could be captured and delivered to the algae, as well as the large number of sewage and wastewater treatment plants, also make the Middle East an ideal location for industrial algae cultivation.</p>
<p>Indeed, several organizations in the region are already active in the algae industry. In Saudi Arabia, the King Abdulaziz City for Science &amp; Technology is funding an innovative project called Saudi Arabia Biorefinery from Algae (SABA Project) to increase research and training in microalgae-based biofuel production.  In Abu Dhabi, the Algae Research Laboratory and Microbial Environmental and Chemical Engineering Laboratory (MECEL) at the Mazdar Institute of Science and Technology is undertaking research to assess and analyze algae-based fuel for the production of aviation and jet fuel, while Dubai-based Lootah Biofuels is working with Singapore-based algae oil producers, AlgaOil, to develop raw materials for biofuels, such as algae, that contain a high oil content.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect to have completed your research by August 2019, when this round of J-WAFS funding comes to an end?</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully, we will have proven the concept that this technology is capable of supplying light and CO<sub>2</sub> to algae cultures at large scale.</p>
<p>Once we’ve achieved that, the next step is to commercialize the product, either as a spin-out of our research or by working with existing companies that have an interest in this field.  In fact, we aim to start talking to companies in the sector quite early in the process, so we can adapt our research to the actual needs of the market.</p>

13013,J-WEL: A new future for global education,"<h4>In a world driven by the enduring forces of globalization and technological progress, education is crucial.  It unleashes a child’s potential, builds healthier societies, boosts economic growth and fosters peace<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>, according to a study by the Global Partnership for Education, a global organization that aims to dramatically increase the number of children who are in school and learning.</h4>
<p>The United Nation’s 2030 sustainable development agenda, which 193 world leaders signed up to in September 2015, outlines 17 sustainable development goals.  From ending extreme poverty through to ensuring gender equality, developing clean energy, and eradicating hunger, education is essential to the success of all 17 of those objectives<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Education is a human right enshrined in the <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> and the <em>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</em>.  However, around the world an estimated 263 million children and young people were out of school for the school year 2013-14<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a>.  Even more are unable to read, write or count.</p>
<p>UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said: <em>“Countries have promised to provide every child with a primary and secondary education by 2030…  Our focus must be on inclusion from the earliest age and right through the learning cycle, (and) on policies that address the barriers at every stage, with special attention to girls – who still face the greatest disadvantage.</em><a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</a><em>”</em></p>
<p>The UNESCO Institute of Statistics estimates that 25 million – or 41 percent – of the world’s out-of-school children of primary school age have never attended school.  If current trends continue, they will probably reach adulthood without completing a single day of education<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Progress in the Middle East</strong></p>
<p>While there is still much to do to make education a universal experience for all children in the MENA region, there is little doubt that progress is being made.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, the average level of schooling across the MENA region quadrupled in the 54 years between 1960 and 2014.  The adult literacy rate has risen from 59 percent in 1990 to 78 percent in 2010, and MENA governments invest an average of more than 5.3 percent of GDP in funding public education<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia itself appears to be performing well.  Between 2008 and 2012, the youth (15-24 years old) literacy rate for males was 99 percent, while 97 percent of females reached the same threshold<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>However, challenges remain across the region, and indeed, the globe.  In Western Asia, which includes the Middle East and parts of North Africa, 11 percent of primary-age children are out of school, rising to 16 percent at lower secondary age and 33 percent at upper secondary age.  At each of these age groups, significantly more females are missing out on education.</p>
<p>There are also opportunities to improve the quality of education available to those attending school, and as well as doing more to ensure new graduates are ready for the rapidly changing workplace<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/new-future-global-education/#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Change in Education at Scale</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">J-WEL aims to be an incubator for change in education at scale, developing a collaborative network of universities, nations, governments, foundations, and other organizations that will work together to revamp approaches to education.  It will also provide models for extending that change to the realms of primary and secondary education, higher education, and workplace learning.</p>
<p>[embed]https://youtu.be/PfDxjy9ZX2U[/embed]</p>
<p>A guiding focus of J-WEL will be learners in the developing world, populations under-served by education such as women and girls, a growing displaced population that includes refugees, and a workforce in need of STEM knowledge and skills (Science, Technology, Mathematics and Engineering).  Through J-WEL, MIT can provide unprecedented access to high-quality curriculum, pedagogical resources, and learning tools that, alongside policy research, will help address the inequities in global education.<img class=""size-full wp-image-1108 aligncenter"" src=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/left-to-right-mit-president-l.-rafael-reif-fady-mohammed-jameel-president-of-community-jameel-international-mit-vice-president-for-open-learning-sanjay-sarma.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>J-WEL will be an entity within MIT’s open education and learning initiatives.</p>
<p>It will be led by Sanjay Sarma, MIT’s Vice President for Open Learning, and aims to be operational by September 2017.</p>
<p><em>“Through J-WEL, we will forge new and long-lasting collaborations as we learn, share, and train together,”</em> said Sarma.  <em>“To borrow an idea expressed by philosophers and educators across the centuries: J-WEL will help to spark fires in students’ minds, and enable educators to spark solutions to their communities’ most demanding challenges.”</em></p>
<p>J-WEL’s approach will be focused on eight different objectives, including sharing evidence-based research on learning, redesigning schools and programs, developing learning tools and technologies, and informing best practices and policy in education worldwide.</p>
<p>M.S. Vijay Kumar, MIT’s Associate Dean of Digital Learning, will serve as J-WEL’s executive director.</p>
<p><strong>Together for Good – an Ongoing Partnership</strong></p>
<p>J-WEL is not Abdul Latif Jameel’s first initiative with MIT.  The two organizations have been working together for a number of years, determined to bring about measurable and considerable change for the betterment of the world at large.</p>
<p>In 2003, the two partners joined forces to launch the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> (J-PAL).  This focuses on research, policy outreach and training, in a bid to reduce poverty worldwide by ensuring that policy is informed by scientific evidence.  More than 300 million people have been reached by programs tested and found to be effective through J-PAL evaluations.</p>
<p>More recently, the <a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security Lab</a> (J-WAFS) was launched at MIT in 2014, with the aim of promoting, coordinating and leading research related to water and food security that has an international impact.</p>
<p>MIT President L. Rafael Reif, recently visited Saudi Arabia on a trip organized by Community Jameel.  Reif said: <em>“For years, Community Jameel’s commitment to finding practical solutions to complex global problems has inspired all of us at MIT.  We are grateful to Community Jameel for their vision, their partnership, and their unwavering dedication to making a better world.”</em></p>
<p><strong>A priority focus for Community Jameel</strong></p>
<p>As well as the new J-WEL initiative, Community Jameel already has a proud history of empowering educators around the world.  Its stated mission – <em>“We give people the power to improve their lives and the lives of those around them”</em> – is based around six key areas, one of which is Education and Training.</p>
<p>Formed in 2003, Community Jameel believes that <em>“education and training are two of the most important pillars in achieving positive social impact, and to build sustainable communities for current and future generations”</em>.</p>
<p>Three of its programs have both harnessed and highlighted the ongoing power of education.  In 2009, Community Jameel was a founding member of <a href=""http://www.injaz-saudi.org"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><em>INJAZ Saudi Arabia</em></a> working in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the National Commercial Bank and Savola Group to train students and prepare them for the transition into working life.  In just two years this grew into a self-sustaining organization, and Community Jameel remains a member of Junior Achievements worldwide (JA), the world’s largest non-profit organisation specifically designed to focus on young people in school and their first year at university.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/initiatives/education-and-training/abdul-latif-jameel-toyota-endowed-scholarship-scheme"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Abdul Latif Jameel Toyota Endowed Scholarship</a> was launched in 1995, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), to make it possible for ambitious and gifted young people from Middle Eastern and Asian countries to study at this esteemed institution when they would otherwise be unable to do so due to financial constraints.  Students are hand-picked based on their ability, dedication, and potential and supported through their studies to achieve their professional goals.  Since inception, the program has granted scholarships to more than 100 students of different nationalities and graduates have pursued careers in architecture, economics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, physics, and aviation sciences.</p>

<p>Bab Rizq Jameel, the job opportunities creation arm of Community Jameel, also offers exciting education, training and employment opportunities to Saudi Arabia’s youth.  Some have been given the chance to learn new media skills through writing and sports journalism programs, as part of Abdul Latif Jameel’s sponsorship of the Saudi Professional Football League, known universally as ‘Dawry Jameel” (Jameel League in Arabic).  Bab Rizq Jameel also helps young Saudis access employment opportunities that may otherwise be out of reach.  <em>“Bab Rizq has created 3,500 stadium jobs since our sponsorship of Dawry Jameel began,”</em> said Martin Copus, Head of Sponsorship at Abdul Latif Jameel.  <em>“We also have a program with Saudi orphans who are involved as player escorts, and we recently required our events agencies to include Bab Rizq employees in the field crew for any on-field activities we run.”</em></p>
<p>The role of education in the development of strong economies, thriving societies and peaceful international relations is now unquestionable.  With the launch of J-WEL, Abdul Latif Jameel, Community Jameel and MIT are committed to working together towards improving access to education and raising educational standards around the world.</p>

13016,J-WAFS in Action: Addressing the impact of air and water pollution worldwide,"<p>Between 2008 and 2013, global air pollution levels increased by 8 percent<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>.  According to the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), 87 percent of the world’s population now live in countries in which ambient pollution levels exceed air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization – a figure that rises to 90 percent in low- and middle-income countries<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Of cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in low and middle-income countries, 98 percent fail to meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a>.  As air pollution increases, so too does the risk of a range of health concerns – including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>With 5.5 million lives being lost to air pollution in 2013, it is now the fourth leading risk factor for premature deaths worldwide<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"">[4]</a>.  That year alone, it cost the global economy US$ 225 billion<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"">[5]</a>.  Laura Truck, Vice President for Sustainable Development at the World Bank, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Air pollution is a challenge that threatens basic human welfare, damages natural and physical capital, and constrains economic growth.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agriculture is a significant factor in the growth of air pollution.  The introduction to the air of large quantities of ammonia, either from fertilized fields or livestock waste, enables it to combine with other pollutants to create particulate matter (otherwise known as PM2.5<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>) – tiny particles that are about 1/30<sup>th</sup> the width of a human hair<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"">[7]</a>.  These particles are small enough to enter people’s lungs and are known to cause deadly illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"">[8]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Working towards a cleaner, healthier future</strong></p>
<p>While air pollution is undoubtedly a global problem, the highest concentrations of PM2.5 have been found in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and South and East Asia.  In 1990, there were 3,945 deaths in Saudi Arabia as a result of air pollution, and its measurement stood at 49.7 µg/m<sup>3</sup>.  By 2013, that measurement was 54 µg/m<sup>3</sup>, the third highest population-weighted mean concentration of air pollution in the world, and 6,285 people died in Saudi Arabia in 2013 as a direct result of air pollution<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>There is not just a human cost to air pollution: the economic impact is considerable, too.  Across the MENA, in 2013 labor income losses from air pollution were more than US$ 9 bn<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn10"" name=""_ftnref10"">[10]</a>.  However, a growing population means the need for large-scale agriculture is set to continue to rise – so innovative solutions are required to tackle this urgent and increasingly pressing issue.</p>
<p>Through the Abdul Latif Jameel World Water and Food Security Lab (<a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/"">J-WAFS</a>) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Abdul Latif Jameel is attempting to provide answers to some of the planet’s biggest challenges – including pollution.  By funding pioneering research into new technologies, J-WAFS aims to coordinate and promote research that will have a measurable and international impact on humankind.</p>
<p>Twenty-four projects have been supported by J-WAFS since 2015, with US$ 1.4 million being awarded in the latest round of seed grant funding announced in May 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the impact of air pollution on crop yields</strong></p>
<p>One project supported by J-WAFS attempts to assess and predict the impact of air pollution on future agricultural yields.  The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) estimates that, in 2000, ozone caused approximate global losses for the three main crops grown across the world – soy, wheat, and maize – of 6-16 percent, 7-12 percent, and 3-5 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Colette Heald is Associate Professor and Associate Department Head of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at MIT.  She has worked extensively with CEE PhD student Luke Schiferi on a project designed to better understand the relationships between ozone precursor emissions, particulate matter, and crop yields.</p>
<p>With growing concern about air pollution levels and increasing global demand for food, air pollution poses a significant threat to global food security.  Together, Heald and Schiferi are using modelling and statistics to better understand the potential effects of particulate matter on future crop yields.  They aim to develop a fuller understanding of the uncertainties humans face, and help to shape policy accordingly over the coming decades.</p>
<p>Their initial results suggest a complex balance between the impacts of ozone and particulate matter on global crop yields: in some regions, particulate matter offsets some – but not all – of the ozone damage, though the impact of particulate matter on global crop yields remains uncertain.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In areas more susceptible to ozone pollution, for example, farmers could be encouraged to plant more ozone-resistant crops,”</em> says Schiferi.</p>
<p>He also notes that this research suggests how <em>“it’s important to be aware of the hidden cost” of air pollution policies and regulation that decrease the amount of particulate matter in the atmosphere.  Given the enhancing effects of particulate matter, any policies which lead to a reduction in particulate matter pollution could have negative impacts on crop production,”</em> he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Safer water for all</strong></p>
<p>Air pollution is not the only area of concern that J-WAFS researchers are helping to combat: water pollution is also causing problems around the world.  In many countries, agriculture is a key factor in the rise of water pollution, with the use of pesticides, fertilizers and other agrochemicals increasing significantly since the 1950s<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn11"" name=""_ftnref11"">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Supported by a seed grant from J-WAFS at MIT, a team of the world’s leading researchers have developed a novel new method to remove even extremely low levels of unwanted compounds from water<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn12"" name=""_ftnref12"">[12]</a>.  Pesticides, chemical waste products and pharmaceuticals can all be dangerous – even when found in only relatively low concentrations.  The new approach, outlined in <em>Energy and Environmental Science</em>, uses an electrochemical process to selectively remove these organic contaminants. It does this by using ‘faradaic’ materials – materials that can be positively or negatively charged – by adding charge, researchers can fine-tune the materials to attract and remove pollutant molecules at the smallest concentrations.</p>
<p>Compared to the two most popular existing solutions, this new method addresses the key limitations of conventional separation methods, such as cost, power and chemical treatment requirements.</p>
<p>The research won the 2016 MIT Water Innovation Prize, and the team behind it has already applied for a patent on this new process.  The system was developed by the research of MIT’s Ralph Landau Professor of Chemical Engineering T. Alan Hatton, MIT postdoc in chemical engineering Xiao Su, as well as five others from MIT and the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MIT postdoctoral researcher Xiao Su, a leading figure in the development of the technology, believes it could make a significant impact on the world’s water supplies.  He said<em>: “Such systems might ultimately be useful for water purification systems for remote areas in the developing world, where pollution from pesticides, dyes, and other chemicals are often an issue in the water supply.  The highly efficient, electrically operated system could run on power from solar panels in rural areas.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it still needs to be further tested to validate technical viability under real-world conditions, the prototype system has achieved promising results.  A video and more information on the research can be seen <a href=""http://news.mit.edu/2017/electrochemical-clear-pollutants-water-0510"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Investing in our future communities</strong></p>
<p>Finding sustainable and effective ways to tackle air and water pollution is a major challenge around the world, but it is clear that some regions are affected more than others: just 6 percent of all deaths linked to air pollution do not occur in low- and middle-income countries<a href=""https://alj.com/ar/openingdoors/en/issue/summer-2017/addressing-impact-air-water-pollution-worldwide/#_ftn13"" name=""_ftnref13"">[13]</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/hassan-jameel/"">Hassan Jameel</a>, President of Community Jameel in Saudi Arabia, said: <em>“Developing technology like this is key to addressing water and food security, and clearing a common problem facing the world today.  That is why J-WAFS is continuing to explore the power of science and technology to positively impact millions of lives.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through its continued investment in J-WAFS, Abdul Latif Jameel is empowering the world’s sharpest minds to work towards solving some of mankind’s biggest problems.  Only by working together and investing in world-leading research can we hope to build a brighter, more sustainable future for all our citizens and communities.</p>
