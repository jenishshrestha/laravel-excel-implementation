Unable to find any, he became determined to establish a wellbeing center for the elderly that available and accessible for all.  A place that centered quality of life at the core of its rehabilitation practice; prioritizing accessibility, without compromising quality.  With these values in mind, he set out to realize his dream.  Tragically, before completion, the late Sheikh Abdul Latif Jameel passed away.  However, his children made sure to make this dream a reality.  In honor of their Father’s passing, the Jameel Family transformed his original dream of an elderly home into a state-of-the-art rehabilitation center - the first of its kind  in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The Abdul Latif Jameel Rehabilitation Center was officially opened and inaugurated under the stewardship of Prince Majid bin Abdul Aziz in 1997.</p>
<p>As the  Center grew and thrived, so did the medical needs of its inpatients, who often made the center their home for months or years on end. In response, the center expanded to include multiple clinics, catering for the medical needs of its residents.  As its success grew, it expanded to become a hospital for all and today pioneers new therapies and treatments such as the Cyberdyne HAL exoskeleton for spinal injuries.  It has now become the GCC training hub for this technology.</p>
