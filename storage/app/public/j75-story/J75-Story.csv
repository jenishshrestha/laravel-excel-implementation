58585,"Makoto Gonokami 五神 真","<p>Dear Mr. Hassan Jameel,</p>
<p>First of all, please allow me to congratulate you on the 75 years of Abdul Latif Jameel and the philanthropic activities of your family.</p>
<p>This is quite an impressive accomplishment.  I particularly respect Community Jameel’s philanthropy in supporting academia to alleviate world poverty.  I would like to express our deep appreciation of what you have done for us as a member of UTokyo Global Advisory Board.  We are very grateful that you have contributed quite a [great] deal for the University of Tokyo.  I trust that Abdul Latif Jameel will reach to new heights in the coming days.</p>
<p>The University of Tokyo is also working hard to achieve the SDGs [UN Sustainable Development Goals] as much as possible and we like to make our university more inclusive.  We are particularly encouraging innovative research collaboration across different disciplines within and between universities. I am very happy to be able to reassure you that we share the fundamental goals on how universities can contribute more to making our society better and sustainable. I greatly appreciate your generosity and continuous support for us. There will be no doubt that our relationship will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, I would like to say that 2020 is not just a corporate anniversary, it is an anniversary of an awesome journey led by a group with brave spirit of philanthropy.</p>
<p>I feel honored to be able to celebrate such epochal event of the 75th Anniversary with you. All members of the University of Tokyo wish you a prosperous future to come.  Once again, congratulations!</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Nine years have passed, since Abdul Latif Jameel and Sumitomo Corporation, first met.  At that time, through a lot of discussions we came to the conclusion that we have similar corporate culture and can work as strategic partners respecting each other.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2012, we succeeded in jointly establishing Abdul Latif Jameel-Summit which is an exclusive Komatsu Distributor in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>It was my dream to establish a distributor in Saudi Arabia for Komatsu Ltd., the world's best brand of construction &amp; mining equipment, together with such a well reputed company as Abdul Latif Jameel.</p>
<p>Since then, we have been experiencing both difficult and good times.  Although the threat of COVID-19 becomes more serious, let us overcome difficulties together.</p>
<p>We wish for your continued success and prosperity in the future.</p>

<p>Simply, the way he put it to me, I could not say 'no', and Hassan is a very charismatic and astute businessman.</p>
<p>the other thing is when I joined Abdul Latif Jameel Machinery in 2013, I had a five minute orientation with Mr. Mohammed Jameel, and in that five minutes the one thing he told me, very loud and clear, was ""<em>Arif, we are coming into a new</em> [industry]<em> segment and however we have a huge </em>[customer service] <em>reputation of the past 75 years; you should not do anything - at all - that would affect this reputation adversely.""</em></p>

By helping me along the way in case I needed help with with whatever they're doing especially with Community Jameel that does a lot of work in social entrepreneurship and social enterprise - so, to keep it very short, they changed my life by just allowing me to attend the top university in the world and by giving me support to continue that journey in this university.</p>
<p>It has definitely, I think , broadened my horizon.  Sort of, coming to MIT you don't really get exposure to the different fashions of the community to the different people from different socio-economic standards, which is one of the main reasons that I started doing social entrepreneurship, so they really show you,  Abdul Latif Jameel although, sort of, they helped me with the scholarship, they also helped me open my eyes towards what this world really has, and how I can use my MIT education to benefit those in need because I was so sort of fortunate to attend this institution.  Fortunate to receive the support from them.  And the only rational thing is is to give back to your community, the only thing that you can do is give back to your community.  So they helped me open my eyes towards what the community lacks, what hides behind closed doors, what the community needs you in, and give me support to to allow me to give back to the community.""</p>

<p>It gives you the empowerment, which I suppose is what we all want. We want that that kind of feeling that we're in control and that we can create something that's quite quite long-lasting and a I suppose, yeah, part of the infrastructure of a ALJ.</p>
<p>The thing you've got going for you is you've got real intelligent people.  I mean, we've got some of the best people here from their backgrounds whether it's finance, purchasing, you know, management.  They're all here.  And it means that, you know, collectively you've got the power in the room to solve a problem.  Or someone's experienced a problem.  So, I think it's really . . .  that's what makes the organization enjoyable, then also I say, yeah, really kind of exciting to work I suppose.</p>
<p>Really the power of ALJ is that it can, kind of, unify its resources and,  give people that empowerment because as a project owner, I'm nowhere near as skilled enough to bring this together, but you've got this power below you that enables it, and it's really, I guess, very rewarding when it all comes together nicely.</p>
<p>Which, doesn't mean it's any easier to do it here, but it does mean we definitely know how to problem solve and deliver on the objective, which I think execution is key to us - and delivering on time is really what it's all about.""</p>

<p>I'm very proud of the part of these big celebration, seventy five years is a long time and I'm looking forward to keep on celebrating great achievements, great investments and great diversification plans with with the Company for another at least 25 years.""</p>

<p>Then I, now I am translating those learnings into a low-carbon future of the World, transitioning and helping this energy system, such that we will be able to change the course of climate change.  We will be able to help energy security wherever we are and also do that in a cost-efficient way for the consumers.  [So], that they will see a financial reduction in their energy bills.</p>

63814,"Arantxa Mencía","<p>""The first memory that came to my mind, it was . . .  I will never, never, forget the day I joined Abdul Latif Jameel, because the same day, my second child was born.  We were signing the agreement with a small company we had in Spain (Stakia for Water).  Abdul Latif Jameel decided to incorporate that company within the group: Almar Water Solutions was created.</p>
<p>We were with the notary signing the agreement at three-thirty in the afternoon . . .   and at five pm, my girl was born!  I rushed from the notary to the hospital!</p>
<p>So, the 'Almar Project', for me, is also like my little kid!  Both of them are three years old; it has been an adventure!  And I'm very happy for that.</p>
<p>It has been a very intense three years, but I have to say the most challenging, and the one I have felt the most positive about being part of this group is the 'Shuqaiq Project.'  It has been a challenge as as Almar we were very new company, Abdul Latif Jameel didn't know us so much, and one day we arrive with a project of US$ 600 million!  An entirely new project of a large desalination plant.  But, we have felt, always, backed by the Company, encouraged.  And although we had some tough times (it hasn't been an easy project) we have always counted on the [Jameel] family and they have been backing us and it has been a pleasure to be part of that.""</p>

<p>The second thing I think is also the innovational spirit that is in the group especially on Mr. Jameel.  He can be quite active with WhatsApp, sending messages about a lot of technologies that appear all around the world and it is true because his his he can collect a lot of information with the different people that he meets with and also with a lot of initiatives that they have in different institutions including including MIT, and he sends forward to all of us.  And he can be very intense with WhatsApp and he's quite curious about what is going on, and how those new things can be implemented in the business also and that is very good because that pushes the team.""</p>

<p>Mohammed Jameel is a warm man.  He knows about everything that happens in the organization, he knows about the personal problems that everyone has in the organization.  I went through very tough times, a couple of years ago, personal times, with my wife who was sick.  And some of the, you know, when my wife passed away one of the first messages of condolences was from Mohammed Jameel.  So, this makes you feel important.  Makes you feel that you are part of something which is not only an organization but closer to a family.</p>
<p>The experience has been really exciting for all of us.  Has been very positive.  I do believe that we have developed the business, in a sense, that we probably could not have thought about without the support of the Jameel family.  And we feel really proud of what we've done together.</p>

<p>There was one time, my car had some problem with the accelerator pedal. I decided to send my car to ALJ for repair. The enthusiasm of service reception girl impressed me.</p>
<p>After the inspection, the problem had been settled. And I was happy about the result and the parts requiring replacement. They very efficiently to dismantled my car and found the parts which need to be replaced. After some time, my car came back to me. And I was told the car was repaired and I was free to go. I was shocked and wanted to know the reason.</p>
<p>I was informed that no parts were replaced and the problem was settled by fine-tuning. I was very impressed by their honesty and professional skills. From that time on, I knew ALJ will be my relying partner. I could feel their passion about work, positive attitude with customers, reasonable price and comfortable facility.</p>
<p>When I purchased my first personal car, I had visited many dealers of various brands with my wife. At the last, we both agreed to place the order in ALJ for Yaris.</p>
<p>During my daily use of my first car, I obtained a very good service experience and that’s why ALJ is the only dealer I thought of when I want to replace my car. We traded our old car with a new RAV4 in ALJ, and at the moment, we feel like ALJ was not only a dealer to us but more like a family who was taking good care of us</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Jameel,</p>
<p>I would like to express my sincere congratulations on your 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Abdul Latif Jameel and share my admiration and respect for your impressive accomplishments across various businesses and social contributions.</p>
<p>It is our pleasure to be one of your partners and establish our business together. I also trust that Abdul Latif Jameel will continue on to the 100<sup>th</sup> year anniversary and look forward to sharing that celebration with you.</p>
<p>I remember we first met in our Tsukuba office in December 2014, over an hour from Tokyo, and although rather late at night due to our schedules, you were very keen to meet and expressed a deep interest in our “wearable cyborg HAL” and its mechanism. I feel highly honored to be your partner and impressed your passion.</p>
<p>After that, we started our business partnership together right away, and the technology was available at the Abdul Latif Jameel Hospital in Jeddah after all necessary government approval. I believe we are making outstanding progress together and collaborating well and look forward to expanding our relationship across the Middle East with therapist training from Abdul Latif Jameel Hospital for other countries. I could not have entered region without such an excellent partner, and much appreciate your warm continuous support for us.</p>
<p>I am delighted to celebrate your 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary. From all of us at Cyberdyne we wish you, and the whole Abdul Latif Jameel team all the best for the future. Happy anniversary!</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Mohamed Jameel,</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear the news of the 75th Anniversary of Abdul Latif Jameel.</p>
<p>The success of Abdul Latif Jameel over the past 75 years is thanks to your dealers, employees, and especially to your customers.   At Hino Motors, Ltd., I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude for your success.</p>
<p>It was the clear vision of your father that led to the foundation of business in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 75 years ago. Since then, under your strong leadership, Abdul Latif Jameel has grown strength to strength.</p>
<p>In October 2018, we at Hino Motors, Ltd. unveiled the ""Challenge 2025"", corporate outline for the future, which will serve not only to give direction to Team Hino around the world, but also to convey this direction to our customers and to the public at large.</p>
<p>Through the decades of shared history, Abdul Latif Jameel has become one of the indispensable members of global Team Hino. We are sure that Abdul Latif Jameel will write a new chapter of Hino history in resonance with ""Challenge 2025"".</p>
<p>We truly appreciate your support and hope it will continue to the future in order to make the next 25 years as successful and memorable as it has been over the past 75 years.</p>

<p>As chairman of the NYK Group, please allow me to offer my utmost congratulations to Abdul Latif Jameel Company Limited. on the 75th anniversary of its founding.</p>
<p><br />
Almost 50 years ago, in 1971 to be exact, NYK began shipping Toyota vehicles and automotive parts from various origins to the ALJ Group mainly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Amid stagnation in the early 1990s and a boom in the 2000s, NYK remained committed to delivering vehicles of the highest quality.  Today, the ALJ Group is the No. 1 car distributer in Saudi Arabia, and as a result of the synergy between our two Groups, NYK has grown to become one of the largest car carriers in the Middle East and around the world. At NYK, we have the greatest respect for the historical partnership that we have developed with the ALJ Group over the years.</p>
<p><br />
Since our founding in 1885, the NYK Group has been a part of the development of the world economy and the subsequent improvements in quality of life for people around the globe. We are proud of the role that we have in supporting the lives of so many, and we carry out our responsibilities by creating value for society while meeting its requirements for safety and environmental protection. We are truly grateful for the trust that we have been accorded over the years, and particularly our everlasting partnership with the ALJ Group.</p>
<p><br />
The commercial relationship between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Japan has brought benefits to us all, and we are proud that the ALJ Group and the NYK Group have helped the economies of the two countries thrive, our cultures become closer, and goodwill among our people blossom.</p>
<p><br />
The ALJ Group has my enduring wishes for many more years of prosperity and triumphs.</p>

Very respectfully yours</p>

<p>One of the most important philosophies I learned from Jameel-san, is that crisis is an opportunity.  In this year we face COVID-19 crisis and he gave us a message that we should stay positive and under the crisis we could help more companies in Japan and elsewhere.  When everyone was concerned about future, concerned about what happens next, I was very much encouraged by his words and I could stay positive under the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>I believe that his positive attitude is source of strength and energy for ALJ.</p>
<p>I am very happy to be part of the celebration of ALJ's 75th anniversary and looking forward to the 100 year anniversary, may I still hope to be alive!!""</p>

<p>I think one of the best things that we achieved together with Abdul Latif Jameel since forming the joint venture is company size, yes we quadrupled the number of our people; our revenue significantly as well; our reach into new sectors, such as the public sector in Saudi [Arabia] and other big companies - big family companies - similar to Abdul Latif Jameel.</p>
<p>And what's really great with the joint venture with them, is that we managed to turn Four Principles from a boutique small consulting company into a company that can help more and more organizations in the region in both the public and private sector.

<p>We would like to congratulate each member at Abdul Latif Jameel for your 75 years of dedicated service worldwide.</p>
<p>Ten years after the establishment of ALJ in 1955, the partnership between Toyota and ALJ began when 4 units of Land Cruisers were imported to Saudi Arabia. During that time, when the market was dominated by American and European brands, it was certainly not an easy decision to start a business with an unknown brand like Toyota. The auto business, which started from a small showroom next to a gasoline station and sold only 5 units, has grown to sell over 100,000 units in just 20 years and is now the world’s largest independent Toyota distributor. During our collaborative journey, we have together built a strong relationship based on mutual trust and this successful journey was an outcome of your ceaseless efforts and overcoming uncountable hardships.</p>
<p>We admire all of your tireless work in not only business activities centered on automobile sales and services, but also contribution to the society through Community Jameel in the spirit of SDGs, to earn greater respect, appreciation, and trust from our local customers and society.</p>
<p>We are also extremely proud that ALJ is committed to promoting motorsport through activities such as Dakar Rally, and the 3-year contract as main partner for all Saudi motorsport tournaments. Not only will this garner greater interest in cars among younger generations, but also help to grow the Toyota fan base in Saudi Arabia, as well as contribute to “Vision 2030” through sports activities.</p>
<p>With a common vision for the future to make the world a better place through “mobility for all”, we sincerely wish you all continued success in the next 75 years, as you strive to mass produce happiness in each and every customer you service in your country, town and branch. Last but not least, we wish you and your family prosperity, happiness, and good health. Let’s continue to work together as ONE TEAM, ONE TOYOTA!</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>

82174,"L. Rafael Reif","<p>""I met Mohammed, maybe for the first time, in the mid ’90s, maybe early ’90s to mid ’90s.</p>
<p>I remember my initial reaction is — very much what stayed with me all these years — is an extremely kind, generous, pleasant person, easy to talk to, very intellectually stimulating.  And the part that I remember the most that has been true to this day, and is the part that I enjoy the most, is his curiosity.  He's incredibly curious about just about everything.  And that each time we have a conversation, not only I enjoy it thoroughly, but it always makes me think.  And there is not a single conversation that doesn't end with me trying to do something, that I know that I’ve got to do something.  And, quite frankly, very often, it makes us both to something together, which is even better.</p>
<p>So, Mohammed would turn to me at a surprising moment to say, <em>“Well, what's your latest idea?  What are you thinking these days?”</em>  And that — that, just about every time — whatever I share with him gets much better in the conversation and becomes an action item for he and I to do something together – it has happened quite a few times in the last few years.</p>
<p>There is so much to admire about Community Jameel.  There are many family foundations, of course, and just about every one of them focuses on a particular topic or domain whether its museums, or the arts, or, or health, or education.  Community Jameel, it feels like its goal is basically to improve the human condition – it’s to do whatever is needed to improve the human condition.  To impact the lives of many people who society has forgotten.</p>
<p>And, and that seems to . . . that's really, what drives Mohammed - and that seems to be what's driving Community Jameel.  And that is, that is something really to recognize and admire - it's very unusual!  I don't know of any other foundation that focuses so much on impacting people. People who need to be touched.  It's always important for them to impact large numbers of people with what they do.  Whether it's with poverty or whether it's water insecurity, you name it - that's a critical component of everything they do.</p>
<p>Community Jameel has been extremely important to MIT.  Community Jameel really cares deeply about improving the human condition, improving what’s, what needs to be fixed in the world.  MIT is very much the same way.</p>
<p>It's really a perfect match.  And they have been to us an amazing force to enable all the things we want to do.  We're addressing poverty; that's important to Mohammed and to Community Jameel.  We're addressing water and food insecurity; that's important to them.  We’re addressing education worldwide, whether it’s in refugee camps; that's important to Community Jameel.  We're addressing the use of technologies like AI in health; that's important to them.  So, the matching goal from objectives is pretty much perfect.  And they have enabled MIT to do all the things that MIT actually wants to do as well.</p>
<p>Mohammed has described to me, years ago, how his father brought him up and educated him.  And the tremendous respect and love that Mohammed has for his dad comes through strongly in those conversations.  And it's very clear that that shaped Mohammed’s view of the world.  And that, and it's very clear, that also has shaped the way he has brought up his own children.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion Community Jameel, the whole Jameel family, is truly a gift to the world.""</p>

<p>Their address.</p>
<p>We shared an analysis that these issues were at their heart about injustice, but I was struck by his engineer-like razor focus on finding specific solutions.  He introduced myself and my campaigner colleagues to Esther Duflo at the [Abdul Latif Jameel] Poverty [Action] Lab (<a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a>) at MIT in 2005.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.one.org/"">ONE Campaign</a> believes strongly in 'factivism', and the work of the Poverty Action Lab and <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel'</a>s commitment to forensically researching evidence-based interventions has been game changing. </p>

<p>As an architect I worked very closely with <a href=""https://artjameel.org/about/fady-jameel/"">Fady Jameel</a> to realize this project as well as with <a href=""https://artjameel.org"">Art Jameel</a>,  who are filled with philanthropy and support to the local arts scene in Jeddah and the rest of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Most importantly in recent times the Jameel fund created a special endowment, here at The Met, to foster initiatives in the area of Middle Eastern culture and art: a) acquisitions, b) supporting programing and c) supporting the translation of educational materials of The Met into Arabic.</p>
<p>I have to say that I was privileged to visit the <a href=""https://jameelartscentre.org/"">Jameel Art Center in Dubai</a>, most recently just before the pandemic, and I was simply blown away by the ambition of the center; by the excellence of its' programing; the beauty of its' architecture and the important position that it takes in the Middle East as a regional hub for the exchange of art and culture.</p>
<p>And that's also what our relationship - between The Met and the Jameel family - is all about: fostering the exchange; fostering the understanding; fostering the ability to have art flourish, especially art from the Middle East, and we'll continue to do so.</p>
<p>So, we're happy to collaborate and I want to congratulate again Community Jameel [and <a href=""https://artjameel.org"">Art Jameel</a>] for their 75th birthday.""</p>

<p>Whilst our relationship with Art Jameel might seem short, at three years, it feels like we've been working together for much longer.  Perhaps this is because we share mutual aims, and over the last decade, or more, we have been admiring Art Jameel's commitment to art education, to access to the arts and developing individual practitioners, artists and curators.  Now people, ultimately, make up organizations and the conviction and the power of the arts to transform society is one that is strongly held by everyone whom I have had direct contact with, from <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammad Jameel</a>, to <a href=""https://artjameel.org/about/fady-jameel/"">Fady Jameel</a>, Antonia Carver, the Director of Art Jameel as well as the entire team at <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>.  </p>

<p>At one level, it is the celebration of a 75 year old vision of exemplary entrepreneurship straddling diverse sectors; at another it is the celebration of a 75 years of a tradition that stands out for its philanthropic commitment and community support.</p>
<p><a href=""https://artjameel.org"">Art Jameel</a>, Bab Rizq Jameel and <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> are integral parts of a vision that helps us look beyond the material aspects of life.  It was in 2003 that the group has made serious inroads into efforts for social change.</p>
<p>I am happy to have associated with Art Jameel and its multifaceted bouquet of activities aimed at enriching the art scene in the Gulf and beyond.</p>
<p>I believe the contributions of Art Jameel in nurturing the art scene and the region have been spectacular.  It has done more than most, in fostering contemporary art practices and creative entrepreneurships in the Middle East.  It has also provided a vibrant platform for cultural dialogue and exchange across boundaries.</p>
<p>I share your vision and your noble goals.  It has been a delight working together with you for taking our art scene to newer heights of creativity on this momentous occasion when Abdul Latif Jameel completes 75 years of impressive work across sectors, I wish you continuous success and accomplishment for years to come.</p>
<p>I would like to end by reminding everyone of Abdul Latif Jameel's Founder's favorite Arabic proverb, which is so inspiring:  <em>""If a wind blows; ride it!""</em></p>

<p>More importantly as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of this wonderful organization we also celebrate our contribution to community.</p>
<p>I joined ALJ, and I came from a world that's completely different.  A world that really knew nothing about the heart.  A world that focused on really driving numbers, driving results, but at Abdul Latif Jameel, I was able to see how that, is nicely coupled with the passion for people.  The passion for love in the workplace.</p>
<p>I have seen the two displayed so nicely, so beautifully, and frankly speaking I, I learned so much, about how you can really drive business results with a passion for standing with the smallest in the organization anytime they claim that they have a grievance of any kind.  I've learned here that actually, if you really want to drive results, if you really want to get growth, you must look at the hearts of the people.  Because it's the people that delivered the results.</p>

<p>Working with my grandfather - in those days I was still young, I was in school - I remember he was in a wheelchair, but he used to consistently, every day, visit [Abdul Latif Jameel Motors Toyota] branches.  Even when he was sick and admitted sometimes to the hospital next day, I would find him in the office.  I would see how humble is he with the tea-boy, with his office manager, and it was weaved into my mind and heart - how humble is this guy?   How great is he, and at the same time how humble is he?  And how kind he is with people.</p>
<p>I'm working on his biography, so I know some of the history and the kindness that he used to do.</p>
<p>He assigned someone to do some legal work and legal case and this guy did it very professionally, and did not cost him much.  If he had lost the case, it would've cost him a lot.  And when he came back, and understood that the case is closed, he went to him and he said: ""do you own a home?""   He said ""No I don't own a home,  I rent.""  so, basically after a few weeks, he took him, and passed by and took him himself, to a small villa.  And he told him ""How do you like this villa?"" so, he said ""it's a beautiful villa"";  he says ""This villa is yours!""  because he valued the achievement of this guy.  And because he's very, very fair, he gave him this opportunity to have to own his house.  And up to today, this guy lives in his house.</p>

<p>And His Royal Highness was interested in this family, who were doing so many remarkable <a href=""https://artjameel.org"">philanthropic</a> things that very closely chimed with work that he had been doing over many years.</p>

<p>And it's a delight to watch the way that organizations respond to that sort of <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">philanthropy</a>; where it is genuinely the love of the people and of the challenge that they all want to remove, rather than simply an interest in the issue.""</p>

<p>I learned many things from him, even my own lifestyle and that of my family, changed completely.  And certainly if I left the Company in any case either for retirement or passing away, I will be very certain because Mashallah the third generation is not far from the second, nor the first.  And with this intellectual transformation, Abdul Latif Jameel will remain, not for another 75 years, but 150 years.</p>

<p>We were asked to give a presentation by His Royal Highness, to His Majesty King Abdullah of the work that the school is doing in the Arab world and then that was the end of it.  The meeting was finished, and then that evening, I got a call from Mr. <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a>, saying I was hearing very carefully what you were saying and I'd like to speak to you more about this.  So, I was very pleased and honored that something happened that day, and somebody actually was paying attention and valuing what we were giving and we spoke for a very long time about what we do, how we engage with young people, how we work in the Arab world, how we have a vision to create a sense of community, a sense of identity, a sense of worth, through the work of the school.</p>
<p>A few days later, I heard from him again, saying that he would like to support us with a major program in the Arab world and he very kindly gave us an endowment fund to be able to support this project,  This project's been going on now, for a good, well, for over 15 years and has graduated many students has influenced government policy and has been one of the most successful outreach programs that <a href=""https://princes-foundation.org/school-of-traditional-arts"">The Prince's School</a> has done.</p>
<p>My message to Mr. Mohammed Jameel and <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/fady-jameel/"">Fady</a>,  is first of all, one of gratitude and thanks for having the confidence in sharing the vision with us.  We were doing things that not been done in this part of the world before, and I think looking back at that, the gratitude stems from that moment of faith and confidence in letting us do what we wanted to do together.   And over the years providing their support to make it grow and grow and grow, and become a major initiative in the art world.""</p>

<p>I was very impressed by the work they've done.  Their experience in this area is notable and it's really appreciated here in the region.  I feel  like not many people are doing such a kind of thing.  The impact is quite important because when we talk about cities, for example like <a href=""https://artjameel.org/heritage/cairo/"">Cairo</a> or <a href=""https://artjameel.org/heritage/jeddah/"">Jeddah</a>, where they worked to look into the the important, you know, traditions and crafts in these cities; these are actually forms of life of people.  They form their identity and they form their way of living and we are living at times where we are losing such crafts.  For me Art Jameel is a place that is really encouraging artists, but also especially the youth, and that actually attracted my attention.  So, I think all this brings Art Jameel to the fore, and as a leader, in this particular field, in this particular part of the world.</p>
<p>I would like to say congratulations for all the work that you have done in this part of the world for the arts and for culture and for heritage.</p>

<p>When we first participated in the competition to design the Art Center, I was really struck by the ambition and vision of <a href=""https://artjameel.org/about/fady-jameel/"">Fady Jameel</a> he told us that the center must first contribute to the community and harness the power of art to transform their lives and nurture the next generation of artists.</p>
<p>In a way this departs from the conventional order of privileging art over everything else in the design of building its nature.  So, we responded with an architecture that is open, welcoming and calm, made up of a series of courtyards and desert islands.  This, in many ways, is an anthem to the exuberant architecture that you find in Dubai and we're delighted to know that after two years of the Center's opening, it has truly become the house of culture of Dubai.  We continue to receive messages of appreciation and compliments from everyone who has visited the Center.</p>
<p>And I really think that the Center is a true transformative gift that <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/fady-jameel/"">Fady</a> and Art Jameel have given to the community and to the larger art world. And i wish them every success and blessings for many years to come.</p>

83762,"Abdulrahman Gazzaz & Turki Gazzaz","<p>I mean I think, that when you talk about <a href=""https://artjameel.org"">Art Jameel</a>'s impact on the artistic community, the cultural community, and also architects, film-makers and other players in the creative fields, I think that Art Jameel really positions itself as one of the leading institutions where critical thoughts, very well put together exhibitions and very leading programs really have, over the years, proven that, Art Jameel <em>is</em> a leading institution in the field and the region.</p>
<p>It's had a massive effect behind the scenes here in Saudi, but now that <a href=""https://artjameel.org/centres/hayy-jeddah/"">Hayy: Creative Hub</a> is opening, I feel that there is a thirst for these spaces.  Hay: Creative Hub is a conversation that everyone here in Jeddah has been having, maybe, for 10-15 years now.  I mean, it's always 'we need creative spaces'; 'we need a space that really brings people together'.</p>
<p>For us, that's one of the main reasons we became <a href=""https://www.brick-lab.com/"">architects</a>; because we wanted to question this fragmentation of institutions that we have, and it's extremely interesting that Hayy would bring everything together into one cohesive unit.  And that's what we're hopeful for in the future - that the existence of all these different creatives, or students, or lecturers in one single space occupying the space will definitely generate projects, conversations, a more intellectual train of thought amongst the people that are in that space, and hope to create a ripple effect for more and more spaces like that around the region.</p>
<p>It's really refreshing to see an institution with such a high level of organization and a high degree of  professionalism, especially in the region.  So, its refreshing and we're really excited to see how it's going to develop further once Hayy is open.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Jameel Family for having 75 years of amazing achievements.  Thank you for always giving back to the community, and thank you for really engaging, not only superficially, but really working hard to understand the community's needs and responding to that.  That is key for any successful philanthropic work and I think it's something that you should be proud of as a corporation as well.</p>

<p>Any architectural student, worth his salt dreams, of going at least once.  And <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a> was extraordinarily enthusiastic at the idea of trying to set-up something that would give a structure for these visits and where they can have facilities for their research as well as having an extremely easy access so that they can see observe and feel the quality of the places.</p>

<p>From the beginning of he project, I have particularly admired Art Jameel's clear vision in making art accessible to everybody.  Following such a philanthropic vision, the project is realized as a place literally open to the public.  Art Jameel openly supports people connecting to arts, arts connecting people to the world, thus people connecting to the world.</p>
<p>I believe this occasion of Abdul Latif Jameel's 75th anniversary is not only a celebration of the success of the business, but also a celebration of 75 years philanthropic contribution to the region and its history.</p>
<p>I wish Abdul Latif Jameel many more years of accomplishment, opportunity and prosperity.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours</p>

83887,"HRH The Prince of Wales","<p>Ladies and Gentleman, it gives me the greatest possible pleasure to be able to offer my warmest congratulations to <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> on achieving their remarkable 75 years of philanthropy.  Needless to say, that I am only so sorry that I am unable to celebrate with you all in person.  <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a>, and his family, have been tremendous supporters of my <a href=""https://princes-foundation.org/"">Foundation</a> and my School of Traditional Arts, for a great many years.</p>
<p>I first came into contact with <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed</a> when he was supporting the refurbishment of the magnificent <a href=""https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/islamic-middle-east"">Islamic Art Galleries at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum</a>.  I recall, I opened the Galleries in 2006, the same year that Mohammed kindly agreed to become a trustee of the <a href=""https://princes-foundation.org/school-of-traditional-arts"">School of Traditional Arts</a>.  Mohammed has tirelessly served in that role ever since and additionally has served as an extraordinary ambassador for the whole of my Foundation's work, encouraging all those he meets along the way.  </p>
<p>Community Jameel, <a href=""https://artjameel.org"">Art Jameel</a> and my School of Traditional Arts share an ethos, and an artistic outlook, where we together encourage an awareness of the holistic nature of the traditional artist, whose inspiration derives from the higher sources.  And whose skill and dedication creates masterpieces which we can all recognize as part of our world heritage.  I'm delighted therefore, that we have formed partnerships that reach far beyond their origins in London.  Since 2008, my School and Art Jameel have collaborated in <a href=""https://artjameel.org/heritage/cairo/"">Fustat</a> in Egypt, and in 2015, we started our fruitful partnership in <a href=""http://jameelartscentre.org/ajmain/heritage/jeddah/"">Jeddah</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as we look to the future, we are making plans to work together at my Foundation's headquarters at <a href=""http://jameelartscentre.org/ajmain/heritage/scotland/"">Dumfries House</a>, a place that is of the greatest importance to our work and to our future success.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentleman, if I may, I would like to renew my special gratitude to Community Jameel for their support over many years and to extend my warmest congratulations on the occasion of this splendid anniversary.</p>

<p><strong>Veronica Berti Bocelli:</strong></p>
<p>We are <a href=""https://www.andreabocellifoundation.org/who-we-are/letter-from-the-founder/"">Andrea Bocelli</a> and <a href=""https://www.andreabocellifoundation.org/who-we-are/organization/"">Veronica Berti Bocelli</a>, Founder and Vice-President of the <a href=""https://www.andreabocellifoundation.org/"">Andrea Bocelli Foundation</a> (ABF). It is a pleasure for us to join in on the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of Abdul Latif Jameel.</p>
<p>Before we were philanthropists, we had the honor of being friends with <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a> and his vision unquestionably inspired and encouraged us to found our own foundation: in our desire<br />
to optimize and direct our projects in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Since 2011, when we established ABF, he has been part of our Advisory Board and together we have partnered on several initiatives over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>We have founded multidisciplinary research at <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a> in order to develop a system of intelligent perception with a wearable high-resolution tactile display aimed at increasing the independence<br />
of blind people. We have also engaged in fruitful dialogue with the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a> and <a href=""https://jwel.mit.edu/"">J-WEL</a> organizations in our desire to measure the impact of our projects, as well as to offer an innovative educational<br />
approach.</p>
<p>As music was the element that brought us to together in 2019, we have also created a <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/how-we-work/education/bocelli-jameel-scholarship"">scholarship</a> at the <a href=""https://www.rcm.ac.uk/"">Royal College of Music</a> in London with the <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> to benefit the most talented<br />
and disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>We feel grateful for all we have achieved together but moreover we feel grateful for the esteem, trust and good values we have had the privilege of sharing over our time together.</p>
<p>We hope we will have the opportunity to do so in the near future to empower people and communities all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Bocelli:</strong></p>
<p>Dearest <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a>, I remember with pleasure the days in which we met, the extraordinary places in which we were able to talk, and the way in which you inspired me to create the <a href=""https://www.andreabocellifoundation.org/"">Andrea Bocelli Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>I think that I can say that it is thanks to you that today many children in Haiti have a school that they can use.</p>
<p>It is also thanks to you that in Italy, in the places hit by the earthquake, many children have a school and have rediscovered hope.</p>
<p>Therefore, congratulations for this anniversary and a special thanks from me.</p>
<p>I hope to see you again soon.</p>",en,,670907,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Andrea-Veronica-shot.jpg,video,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Andrea-Bocelli-Mohammed-Jameel-KBE-a.jpg,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Community-Jameel-75-Voices-Andrea-Bocelli-EN-16x9-C.mp4,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Andrea-Bocelli-Mohammed-Jameel-KBE-a.jpg,"<p>Founder &amp; Vice-President,  The Andrea Bocelli Foundation</p>",community-jameel-story,,35,Yes,11,"<p>"" . . .  and you inspired me to create the Andrea Bocelli Foundation.""</p>",https://jameel75.com/en/stories/Andrea-Bocelli-&/#038;-Veronica-Berti-Bocelli?WoqrTJmQ8P,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Andrea-Bocelli-.gif,1,1,"2021-02-03 14:21:06",publish,andrea-bocelli

It's been our privilege to be associated with <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> [<a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>] for well nigh twenty years since the day <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed</a>, like a comet, appeared in our lives.  And what a twenty years it has been, watching Abdul Latif Jameel transforms everything it touches: old institutions get better, new ones are created, so much innovation.  Touching so many dimensions of human life.  From climate changing development thinking, to making the arts more open to new talent.  It's been exhilarating.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.  Happy 75th!</p>
<p><strong>Esther Duflo:</strong><br />
It's almost a tautology to say that without Abdul Latif Jameel, there would be no <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a>!  In fact I once referred to Mohammed in his presence as the ""J"" of J-PAL, and he's become very fond of this expression, using it with his nice smile whenever we had an occasion.  But it goes much farther than that: I think without <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> [<a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>] and <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a> in particular, there would, no <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">Poverty Action Lab</a> in the way it is now.  And it is way beyond the funding.  Of course the funding played a critical role in the beginning - allowing us the freedom to do what we wanted to do and the capacity to do it.  The funding was also there at several critical stages in our development when it was appropriate for us to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>But much beyond the funding, there was all the advice, all the conversations, all the wisdom, that we got from Mohammed Jameel from the very beginning.  This same wisdom that we see in all of the work that Abdul Latif Jameel has done for the past 75 years.  From the very beginning, from his very first conversation, we were asked <em>""What is your ambition?""</em> and from this very simple question, we were asked to define our ambition.  And it's been with us since the beginning . . .  we have enjoyed this friendship. We have immensely benefitted from the wisdom and the advice, and we look forward to 75 more years - at least -  of a continuous relationship.</p>
<p>Thank you Mohammed!  Thank you <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> [<a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>]l and good luck for the next 75 years!</p>

<p>When I think of Community Jameel, there are really three hallmarks to your approach that stand out.   The first is your level of ambition in tackling some of the great challenges of our day: the eradication of poverty; the extension of educational opportunity; the fight against the major killer diseases that still afflict so many communities and countries around the world.  Secondly, it's your commitment to evidence and data in the service of the world's poorest people.  Thirdly, it's your commitment to partnership to listening to communities; to learning from communities to understand the problems that they are trying so hard to solve and being there in support and solidarity with them.</p>
<p>We've been deeply honored to work with you and Save the Children on refugee education support for teachers in the Middle East in particular.  And we're looking forward to working with you over the years ahead on our joint program in tackling climate risk in the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>So, from all of us, a big thank you for everything that you've done and to say again that we're deeply privileged to be working with you and looking forward to engagement over the years ahead.</p>

<p>I can only say that it is really a very pleasant and very happy part of my life.  If it was 1989 again, I would definitely choose to work for Abdul Latif Jameel again.  </p>
<p>We wish Abdul Latif Jameel, with all its members, both the small family and the big family, a celebratory 75th anniversary of its foundation.  We look forward to celebrating these successes with the group over and over again.  We hope to celebrate after a short time the first centenary, Inshallah, and to keep celebrating the second and third centenary for life.</p>",en,,670920,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Khaled-Al-Taweel-Head.png,video,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/680x290.png,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Abdul-Latif-Jameel-75-Voices-Khaled-Al-Taweel-AR-EN-Subs-16x9-COMPRESSED-1.mp4,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Khaled-Al-Taweel.png,"<p>Chief Financial Officer<br />

<p>And over the years, I've become a huge fan, not just of the work of <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a>, but of the work of the broader Community Jameel: in health, in education, in climate, and in evidence-based policy making.</p>
<p>They have been pioneers, right at the forefront of innovation from the beginning.  And the incredible thing about this 75 years, is that for every one of those years, and going down through the family and generations, they've always been, at the cutting edge of the future.  They've been people who've understood how the future works, and are prepared to bring the best ideas and the best in innovation to make it work successfully for as broad a number of people as possible.</p>
<p>So it's been 75 years of incredible achievement!  I know it's going to be 75 and more years in the future to come.</p>

83907,"David M. Rubenstein","<p>Over the past 25 years, I've spent a lot of time in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia meeting with investors and other people who've been business partners with my firm and among the most impressive people that I've met is <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a> is an extraordinary individual who taught me the value of learning how to get along with people who you might disagree with; the value of philanthropy; the value of giving back.  And he's and extraordinary business person as well, but actually I have to say, I don't really admire him so much, because he makes me look bad!</p>
<p>He's a much better businessman than I am, a much better philanthropist than I am, much more handsome than I am, a much better father than I am, a much better mentor than I am - and I just have to say to Mohammed Jameel:  stop making me look bad!  You're doing everything so well!  Try not to do things so well, so I can look a little bit better!</p>
<p>But one of the great stories Mohammed  Jameel told me was that is father was a very preceptive businessperson.   Here's what he did:  An ad., was run in a newspaper in Saudi Arabia asking for a distributor to a little company called 'Toyota'.  And the only person who responded favorably to it was Mohammed's father, Abdul Latif Jameel, and he said, yes, he would be the distributor.  Now at that time no-one had really heard of Toyota.  It was close to the end of World War II, I think the early 1950s, and therefore, people weren't interested!  But Abdul Latif Jameel had the insight to say <em>'this company might go somewhere, I'll be the distributor'</em>  and that was the launching of <a href=""https://alj.com"">a gigantic business empire</a> that Mohammed Jameel has done a terrific job of expanding and enhancing.</p>
<p>But what I admire most about Mohammed, honestly, is his <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/"">philanthropy</a>.  His concern with people; his concern with giving back to society, that indeed, the whole <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel family</a> - Mohammed's sons are extraordinary as well.</p>
<p>So, I just want to say: Congratulations on raising terrific children, Mohammed.  Congratulations on being a terrific son to a great father, and congratulations for what you've done in our country, my country, because your philanthropy at MIT and other places is really extraordinary.  So, while I kid about the fact that you make me look bad - and you do - I certainly do admire you.</p>
<p>Congratulations on all that you've done.</p>
<p>Congratulations for having an extraordinary family that makes everyone who knows you proud to say, <em>'yes, the Jameel family, they're a family I know well and I'm proud to call them my friends'</em>.</p>",en,,670925,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/David-Rubenstein-Headshot-1.jpg,video,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/David-M-Rubenstein-thumbnail.jpg,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/Abdul-Latif-Jameel-75-Voices-David-M.-Rubenstein-EN-16x9-C.mp4,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/02/David-M-Rubenstein-thumbnail.jpg,"<p>Co-Founder and Co-Chairman, Carlyle Group</p>",alj-story,,8,Yes,10,"<p>""Mohammed Jameel, an extraordinary individual, taught me the the value of philanthropy; the value of giving back""</p>",https://jameel75.com/en/stories/David-M.-Rubenstein?zjlXxnlTtD,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/03/David-M-Rubenstein.gif,1,1,"2021-02-03 17:28:44",publish,david-rubenstein

<p>I've known <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed</a> for more than 20 years.  For a period of a decade we met all around the world.  I have to say I've known many many business leaders and philanthropists and Mohammed, in particular, is among the most creative driven professional, brilliant, entrepreneurial, in both his commercial and philanthropic activities.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think you know in a funny way, he has taken the best of his part of the world, where altruism is a part of the everyday life and their faith and friendship is paramount; and the lessons learned in Japan about about efficiency and data-driven decisions; and the West where entrepreneurial spirit is the animating spirit of of the Western economy.   And that mix is an amazing amalgamation that has created amazing things.</p>

<p>I am delighted to extend my warm congratulations to the <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> on celebrating 75 years of philanthropy!</p>
<p>This anniversary is a time for reflecting on the past and looking ahead to the future.</p>
<p>I am pleased by the Community Jameel's groundbreaking work that they continue to conduct on the most pressing issues of the world.  They are working towards delivering quality education with disruptive mechanisms in technology, teaching methods, mentorship and programs globally.  The ultimate goal is to eradicate barriers to learning. In the arena of health, they aim to improve healthcare facilities, especially for the poor, using technology like machine learning, robotics and data science.  To tackle the climate crisis, they are working to provide food and water security for everyone with the help of unique technologies.  They conduct intensive research in labs to test what will work in real life and what will not.  No matter what kind of change they are aspiring to make, they do it through evidence-based research within the spheres of data, science, and technology.</p>
<p>Our work on microcredit was chosen by Community Jameel to focus their attention on.  The Community supported US based <a href=""https://grameenfoundation.org/"">Grameen Foundation</a>’s -- Grameen Jameel Initiative to provide Microfinance in several countries in the North Africa, the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.  It also supported a French initiative to produce a feature film on <a href=""https://grameenbank.org/"">Grameen Bank</a> and me.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a> decided to fund the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">Poverty Action Lab</a> at his alma mater <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a>.  It was inspired by Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and was designed to generating creative ideas to solve global poverty.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a> made me a part of the organization he created called <a href=""https://www.coexistfoundation.org/"">Coexist Foundation</a>.  This aimed at interfaith understanding and dialogue.</p>
<p>His representative Tim Ryan supported us on media coverage pro bono for the Nobel Prize events in Oslo in 2006, helping to arrange some of the interviews at the time.</p>
<p>I am very lucky to have friendship with Mohammed Jameel to see his work at a close range.  He is making great contributions to uplift the population which is forgotten by the mainstream decisions and policies.</p>
<p>I send all my good wishes on this occasion of 75th Anniversary to Mohammed, and his organizations, in their journey to making the world a better place.""</p>

<p>The contest ended and we took the first place in the 'social' track.  The cooperation and support we received after winning the MIT contest was amazing.  I felt like I became part of the family.  I am much grateful that I am present in a family.  Whenever I need anything, there's a sister, an aunt, a grandmother to help and back me.  Community Jameel is the same . . .   anything I need is available.</p>
<p>I truly wish them more success, progress and fruitful achievements that would benefit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and push it forward.</p>

<p>It is a great milestone, one that does not just happen.  It is the result of the vision, hard work, risk taking and sacrifice of the founder, your dear father, may he rest in peace.</p>
<p>I know that, because we share the wonderful legacy of having founders who saw beyond the challenges and focused on the possibilities they saw instead, and then made it happen.  And, who all along the way, made it possible and better for others in their community, empowering them and supporting the development of Saudi Arabia, well before anyone coined the term CSR.</p>
<p>We all owe a great debt to these pioneers, who as they grew small businesses into Saudi conglomerates with international reach never lost sight of their Saudi roots and heritage, in which they took great pride.</p>
<p>I am sure your dear father would be so very proud to see how well his children and now his grandchildren have not only sustained his core values, but have grown the business, embraced a pioneering spirit to blaze new trails with an entrepreneurial and innovative flair and supported through a world-renowned philanthropic arm the many communities the business touches, all while remaining true to the Saudi roots from which it all grew.</p>
<p>It has been a great pleasure for me to have gained these insights into your values and approach to business and life firsthand through serving together on various boards. You truly embody the generous spirit of the broader organization.  So, it is not surprising that I often find myself running into someone who knows you, likes you and respects what you, <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> and the other philanthropic arms are doing.</p>
<p>That's a great legacy that will propel Abdul Latif Jameel into a wonderfully bright and rewarding future.</p>

<p>I would describe <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jamee</a>l as someone who is a man of ideas.  So he told me once that<em> ""I have a hundred ideas a week and you don't have to take them all seriously, but I enjoy discussing these ideas with people who enjoy intellectual discussions.""</em>  And the way it has always worked, so far as I have seen, with Mohammed and all of us at MIT, is that we start with the 'big idea' and then we take a look at: for this to be accomplished, what would be needed?  Who are the people?  How would this be done?  if its a question of <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">poverty</a>, or food and water, or <a href=""https://www.jclinic.mit.edu/"">health</a>, what would be the nuances in each and every context across the different parts of the world?</p>
<p>And he's always hands-on.  He likes to be in these conversations, not because he needs to have any control over these conversations, but because he enjoys the intellectual journey.  That's how I see him.  He's a man of ideas most of all, and someone who's truly committed to making a difference in the world.</p>
<p>He loves to amplify our message in ways we may not have been able to do without him, in terms of bringing this to the attention of different kinds of people across the world.  Whether it's governments; whether it's non-profits; whether it's educational institutions - he's been very, very active.  He and <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/"">Community Jameel</a>.  I should say a word about the incredible team that's at Community Jameel that works very closely with us as well.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate you, and I want to thank you Mohammed, <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/fady-jameel"">Fady</a>, <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/hassan-jameel"">Hassan</a> and Community Jameel, for allowing us to be part of your family's legacy to the world because what you do is incredible and for us to be a small part of it is just absolutely inspiring.""</p>

85334,"Khalid bin Hamad Al-Malik","<p>This year marks the 75<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the start of the <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> Company.  If we look at the history of Abdul Latif Jameel, we may feel that its' late founder wanted the company to combine trading with charitable and humanitarian work, as if he had intended to link charitable work with commercial activity, maybe based on his conviction that his trade will not be profitable unless the poor and needy have a share of the profits and proceeds of investments of this giant corporation. He must have instructed his sons to continue and increase these initiatives after him.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the passage of 75 years since the establishment of Abdul Latif Jameel, perhaps we should shed light on the charitable organizations and initiatives launched by Abdul Latif Jameel to reflect their concerns towards the needy inside and outside the Kingdom.  This interest was particularly reflected in <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>'s charitable orientation towards building a better future through job creation, innovation, entrepreneurship, and youth creativity in the Kingdom and in our region, as part of a set of programs offered by the Jameel businesses to beneficiaries within the Kingdom.</p>
<p>It is out of this outstanding charitable, humanitarian and patriotic approach, the idea of ​​'Bab Rizq Jameel' was born, in order to provide job opportunities for young people. This includes support and financing for <a href=""https://brjservices.com/"">entrepreneurs</a>, provision of digital services for the benefit of entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises, in addition to what this charitable section does in terms of linking job seekers with employers.</p>
<p>Bab Rizq Jameel is not a single organization  but rather a group of businesses.  There is employment, another for <a href=""https://brjmf.com/"">financing</a>, and a third for <a href=""https://brjservices.com/"">services</a>.  In each company, there is a set of services with many details, and tight regulations.   As part of Bab Rizq Jameel, a <a href=""http://nafisashams.com/"">women's arts and crafts academy</a> was established. There is also <a href=""https://www.mitefarab.org/"">MIT Enterprise Forum</a>, along with Community Jameel's humanitarian initiatives, all of which share the same goals: care for people's health; prisoner welfare; build mosques; supporting low-income families, widows' families and divorced women, and provide housing for the needy, including rent, furniture, equipment, and much more.</p>
<p><a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> is one that is based on solidarity, humanitarian work, and helping citizens to depend on themselves by providing them with job and education opportunities under the umbrella of Bab Rizq Jameel and other organizations and sections of Abdul Latif Jameel.   Together, these initiatives demonstrate that the sons followed the example of their founding father, and yet expanded in this direction with a clear focus on the same goals set by the founder in serving the people, thanks to the good fortune that Allah Almighty bestowed upon them, and the support and encourage they received from our leadership in those prestigious initiatives.</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">يصادف هذا العام مرور 75 سنة على انطلاقة شركة عبد اللطيف جميل، وكأن مؤسسها - رحمه الله - أراد أن تكون الشركة جامعة بين التجارة والأعمال الخيرية والإنسانية، وكأنه قد تعمَّد ربط العمل الخيري بالعمل التجاري؛ انطلاقاً من قناعته بأن تجارته لن تكون رابحة ما لم يكن للفقراء وذوي الحاجة نصيب من ربح هذه المؤسسة العملاقة، وما يتحقق لها من ريع استثماراتها، ولا بد أنه أوصى أبناءه على استمرار هذه المبادرات وزيادتها بعد وفاته.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">هذه المناسبة، تذكِّرنا مع مرور ثلاثة أرباع القرن على إنشاء هذه الشركة، بما تولَّد عنها من أذرعة ومؤسسات ومبادرات خيرية، تصب وتتجه اهتماماتها نحو المحتاجين داخل المملكة وخارجها، مع تميز هذا التوجه الخيري في مجتمع جميل نحو بناء مستقبل أفضل من خلال خلق فرص العمل والابتكار، وريادة الأعمال، وإبداع الشباب في المملكة وفي منطقتنا، ضمن مجموعة من البرامج التي تقدمها مجموعة جميل للمستفيدين داخل المملكة.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">وكمثال على هذا التوجه الخيري والإنساني والوطني الجميل، ولدت فكرة ""باب رزق جميل""؛ من أجل توفير فرص العمل للشباب من الجنسين، يشمل ذلك الدعم والتمويل لرواد الأعمال، وتوفير الخدمات الرقمية لفائدة رواد الأعمال والمؤسسات الصغيرة والمتوسطة، إلى جانب ما يقوم به هذا الباب الخيري من ربط بين الباحثين عن عمل بأصحاب الأعمال.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">و""باب رزق جميل"" ليست مؤسسة أو شركة واحدة، وإنما هي مجموعة من الشركات، فهناك شركة للتوظيف، وأخرى للتمويل، وثالثة خاصة بالخدمات، وفي كل شركة مجموعة من الخدمات بتفاصيل كثيرة، وتنظيمات محكمة، وضمن هذا الباب تم تأسيس أكاديمية للفنون والحرف خاصة بالنساء، وهناك منتدى MIT لريادة الأعمال، إلى جانب مبرات جميل، وأوقاف جميل، وإفراج جميل، وشفاء جميل، وقوت جميل، وسكن جميل، وقلم جميل، وكلها فروع تخاطب الحس الإنساني، وتعنى بصحته، والإفراج عنه إن كان سجيناً، وبناء المساجد، ودعم الأسر ذات الدخل المحدود وأسر الأرامل والمطلقات، وتوفير السكن للمحتاجين من إيجار وأثاث وأجهزة وغيرها كثير.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">مجتمع جميل، مجتمع يقوم على التكافل، والعمل الإنساني، ومساعدة المواطنين بدعمهم ليعتمدوا على أنفسهم عملاً وتعليماً تحت مظلة ""باب رزق"" وغيره من المؤسسات والشركات التابعة لعبد اللطيف جميل، خاصة أن أبناءه قد حذوا حذو والدهم، وتوسعوا في هذا الاتجاه ضمن الأهداف نفسها التي رسمها الوالد في خدمة الناس، ليكون ذلك شكراً منهم لله على توفيقه وإلهامه، وعلى قيادتنا في دعمها وتشجيعها لهم على هذه المبادرات.</p>",en,,671106,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/03/Khalid-bin-Hamad-Al-Malik-head.png,image,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/03/Khalid-bin-Hamad-Al-Malik.png,,,"<p>Editor-in-chief of Al-Jazeera newspaper<br />

<p>More important are the various contributions of Bab Rizq Jameel to social responsibility in this <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">community</a>.  Bab Rizq Jameel provided 360,000 job opportunities and SAR 2.5 billion in loans over 17 or 18 years, since its establishment.  It has also supported more than 270 thousand productive families. Hearty applause for all who work on this great program.</p>
<p>Today, social responsibility has become part and parcel of the private sector duties.  Its role is upward mobility, youth advancement and creation of job opportunities for our sons and daughters.  </p>
<p>Thanks God for those great example which are seen in the private sector and which drive social responsibility.  I pray to Allah to protect this country and our leaders and to help us complete our mission to realize the 2030 vision that will take the Kingdom - God willing – to its real position, to lead the pursuit of development and advancement in the region.</p>

""I'm  Daniel Roos, a Professor Emeritus at MIT and I've had the privilege of knowing <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed</a> for over 30 years. <img class="" wp-image-85623 alignright"" src=""https://www.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/03/The-Machine-that-Changed-the-World.jpg"" alt=""The Machine that Changed the World"" width=""175"" height=""248"" /></p>
<p>In the 1980s, I led a worldwide study of the automotive industries and published a best-selling book which explained that the reason that the Japanese automobile companies were doing so well was that they were using the 'Toyota Production System'.</p>
<p>Mohammed graciously invited me to a meeting with he and Dr. Toyoda, and that was a very memorable experience for me because we had studied the company but I have never had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Toyoda.</p>
<p>Early on Mohammed said to me: <em>""you know, my father explained to me that we have been very very fortunate in terms of our business success, but we now have a responsibility to give back to society and I have that commitment.""</em>  He would do that with a real understanding and kindness about what he was doing and concern particularly for the people who are going to be affected by this.""</p>
<p><strong>Eva Roos:</strong><br />
""I just want to mention how grateful I am and what an honor it is to know Mohammad for so many years.  And not just because I admire him, not because she's a very decent human being, but I admire him and what he stands for: the betterment of human beings.  I am also very appreciative that I've been at many of the meetings and celebrations where I was included and I'm also very appreciative that he I can count myself as his friend, as well as my husband, well thank you.""</p>

85724,"Dr Susan Hockfield","<p>""<a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a> has an amazing ability to see the possibility for positive change before other people recognize it.  At <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a>, we have benefitted enormously from this future-vision that he has.  Perhaps one of the best examples; Mohammed was among the first to understand the power of, what we now call, the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> (J-PAL).  He quickly appreciated J-PAL's model to understand and design viable routes out of poverty.  In Esther Duflo's parlance, <em>'he really got it'</em>,  that by careful analysis of interventions to alleviate poverty - with controlled studies - the impact of philanthropy to improve lives, could be maximized.</p>
<p>I still - so vividly -  recall my early meetings with Mohammed and how Esther Duflo's and Abhijit Banerjee's project to understand the causes and cures for poverty profoundly resonated with him. And what a fantastic tribute to their work, and his early support, that only about a decade later, the Nobel Prize Committee recognized the value of their work too.</p>
<p>On my first trip to Saudi Arabia, the first of many visits, I saw first hand the depth of Mohammed and <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>'s commitment to improving lives by tackling seemingly intractable problems.  Mohammed himself, took me on a tour of <a href=""https://brjservices.com/"">Bab Rizq Jameel</a> - the incubator he and his family initiated in Jeddah.  Oh my!  Meeting those women, for whom Bab Rizq Jameel was creating jobs, creating entrepreneurs, and providing avenues for women to participate in the economy - I just can't describe how unforgettably moving that experience was.</p>
<p>And now I'm an advisor to the <a href=""https://www.jclinic.mit.edu/"">Jameel Clinic</a>, and have the privilege of a front row seat on another far sighted ambition: to combine the power of computation and biomedical know-how to develop more accurate, more effective health care, for all populations, all over the world.  Already, the Jameel Clinic's work using artificial intelligence to identify a new class of antibiotics, and to make mammography more predictive, and much much more, is already changing the future of health care.</p>
<p>Mohammed really understands MIT's mission to bring our work to bear on the world's most daunting problems.  We meet that mission through science and engineering, and also through clear-eyed analysis of economics and politics.</p>
<p>What a wise and generous friend we have had in Mohammed and Community Jameel and what amazing work they've catalyzed and accelerated.</p>
<p>Mohammed, Community Jameel, congratulations of 75 years of generous, insightful, philanthropy, and thank you for improving the lives of so  any, today, and tomorrow.""</p>

<p>I have known <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed </a>for almost 30 of those 75 years.  Our paths first crossed at <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a> where <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed</a> received his undergraduate education, and where I worked for 25 years.</p>
<p>In my role at MIT, I had the good fortune to work with many philanthropists from around the world, and I can say without hesitation that the deep thinking and focused energy that Mohammed brings to understanding society's challenges, to exploring ways to address those challenges, and then identifying the best institutions and individuals, is second to none.  He does this with equal intensity and curiosity whether in the worlds of science, engineering, health, humanities, or the arts - all, with the goal of expanding opportunity and access to a wider population of people around the world.</p>
<p>Everyone who knows Mohammed well, hears him speak often of his father, and the ethos and values Abdul Latif Jameel brought to his business life and to his family.  And one can see and feel the ways in which Mohammed exemplifies those values and has passed them along to his four children.  As the Company and the family maintain that strong tradition of service and generosity over many years, I believe that Community Jameel serves as a model that has inspired other philanthropists across the global community and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>I'm always heartened when Mohammed says that he is in conversation with other philanthropic leaders around the world.  There is much to be learned - and emulated - as we endeavor, and sometimes struggle, to build a better and fairer world.</p>
<p>So, it is with deep and abiding respect and affection that I join with all of you in saluting Mohammed and the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel family</a>, along with the team of colleagues they have built at <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> and <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel. </a></p>
<p>Today, as we honor the legacy of the past, we look to the promise of the future.  I very much look forward to seeing the fruits of the laborers and generosity that we celebrate today continue and grow in the years ahead.""</p>

85920,"Maria T Zuber","<p>""So, I'd like to start by  talking a little bit about how I became acquainted with the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel family</a>.  A number of years ago <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a>'s current president, then provost, <a href=""https://jameel75.com/en/stories/L.-Rafael-Reif?syjGPffn8F"">Rafael Reif</a>, asked myself and another faculty member to reach out to the MIT campus and to see what parts of environmental studies MIT wanted to amplify and wasn't involved with to the extent that they would really like to be.  And and we did that, and what came out of that was water and food that our faculty really viewed these areas as critical to the human condition and some work was going on but that that work could be amplified in an MIT way.  In ways that could help the world.  And Raphael introduced me to <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a> and asked us to talk about that and <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed</a>'s reaction was: ""well if we did a water and food center how many people do you think you could help?""  And I hadn't really thought about it, and I said well, I bet we could help thousands  - and and he seemed to like that answer.   And that led to the <a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems laboratory (J-WAFS)</a> at MIT.</p>
<p>And one of the first activities that that lab undertook was a study of  a dam in Ethiopia, close to the border of Egypt, and the director <a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/people/john-h-lienhard-v"">John Lienhard</a> called together international experts to investigate the filling of the dam in a way that it wouldn't negatively impact inhabitants of the Nile to the north of the dam.  And that study was undertaken, it was given to the governments of Ethiopia and Egypt and one of the things that came out of the study is there are a hundred million people who get their water from the Nile in Egypt.  And then it impacted me that it was like. oh my god, you know we've we've done something that potentially positively influenced the lives of a hundred million people.</p>
<p>And it then struck me that this is the way that <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a> thinks!  He thinks about impact and he thinks about improving the human condition on a large scale.</p>
<p>Working with the Jameel family has also been a very personal experience for me.  Our collaborations between MIT and <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> have brought me to the Middle East on a number of occasions and I developed an interest in helping women from Saudi Arabia, and more broadly in the Middle East, mainly in the areas of enhanced educational opportunities for women and also how do we assimilate women into the workplace, so that they can help their families, and also help the economies in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East.  And I got a great deal of satisfaction out of my interactions in these activities and I don't think that I would have undertaken this if it hadn't been for my association with Community Jameel - and I am very grateful to them for that.</p>
<p>So, when I reflect on um the 75th anniversary of Community Jameel, I think a lot about how much this family has done for those in need.  Knowing the family, their dedication to their father Abdul Latif Jameel, their values, their compassion, but also their business sense and their drive.  It was really the perfect combination to help people and to associate with others who had similar interests.  You know, I often think that the most important people in the world to the Jameel family are those who have the greatest needs.  And the Jameel family, through Community Jameel, has delivered.  And I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank them for everything that they've done to allow MIT to help others in the world, and that they've done, you know, just for people everywhere.  It's been such an honor and a privilege to be associated with Community Jameel and I just look forward what we're all going to do collectively in the future.""</p>

86382,"Prof. John H Lienhard V","<p>Good morning.  I first met <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a> in a phone call.  He got in touch with me to discuss some ideas we had developed at <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a> about a water and food research program.  I laid my ideas before Mohammed, and he went off and thought about these and he was inspired!  And he came back and he asked MIT to create the <a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Water &amp; Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS)</a>, which we did in 2014.</p>
<p>I'm privileged to direct that lab.  J-WAFS funds advanced research all over MIT directed at providing safe and stable supplies of water and food throughout the world to people at all levels of society and in many countries and places.  We have developed a number of remarkable scientific and technological ideas in the course of this.  We have created companies as a result of this.  And in my mind most importantly we have educated a legion of students who will go out and become future leaders in water and food research, multiplying our impact far beyond what we could accomplish at MIT by itself.</p>
<p>However, as I've learned more about <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed</a> and the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel family</a>, I've come to understand the full scale of their efforts to provide for the human race through advanced programs.  They've created the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">[Abdul Latif Jameel] Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL)</a> at MIT, which uses blind studies to determine which interventions against poverty are effective and which are not, and they have had enormous reach around the world.</p>
<p>The Jameel family has created [the] <a href=""https://www.jclinic.mit.edu/"">Jameel Clinic (J-Clinic)</a> which is marrying artificial intelligence in the practice of medicine to provide better diagnostics, and more rapid treatments for disease.   They've created the <a href=""https://jwel.mit.edu/"">[Abdul Latif Jameel] World Education Lab (J-WEL)</a>, which is aiming to educate educators, so that they can return to their own universities and be more effective in their work.</p>
<p>And outside MIT they have created [the] <a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jameel-institute"">Jameel Institute (J-IDEA)</a>,which is looking at infectious disease at <a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk"">Imperial College London</a>.</p>
<p>However, the Jameel family also operates <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>, which is a broad charity reaching out across the Middle Eastern Region - they do jobs creation, and other forms of outreach touching the lives of many many thousands of people, across that region and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Jameel family has also made major commitments to the arts: they've they've created a beautiful <a href=""https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/islamic-middle-east"">gallery at the Victoria &amp; Albert museum</a>, with stunning artifacts from Islamic art.  They have also created - very special in my mind - <a href=""https://jameelartscentre.org/"">the Jameel Art Center in Dubai</a>, which is reaching out into the community to bring them in contact with contemporary art.  It's not simply 'art on display' to come observe but it's actually community interaction and teaching and programs for children; as well as nurturing of local artists who are specializing around the region.</p>
<p>For all of this I think I can only say thank you to the Jameel family for their generosity and their concern for the well-being of everyone.</p>
<p>We all owe them a great debt for their contributions to making a better world and I hope to see what comes in the future, and where this may continue to blossom and develop.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>We, the people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the government and the people, are proud of the legacy rooted in our religion, culture, history and the nature of our society, which is the supremacy of doing good and raising the status of the philanthropist because of the human values embodied by good deeds and the achievement of the ideals of society in the field of solidarity and compassion. Community Jameel Foundation is an organization that deserves to be cherished because of the deeply rooted values it embodies in our society.</p>
<p>When the late Sheikh Abdul Latif Jameel is mentioned, he is not only mentioned for his success as a great businessman, but more for his social initiatives and his charitable and generous works that have not ceased over the past seventy-five years in his life, and after his death (may Allah rest his soul in peace), thanks to the continuation of his work through his sons and daughters.</p>
<p>This honorable history constitutes a model for the meaning and importance of ‘social responsibility’ for the private sector, which I hope will be a tradition for all private sector institutions and companies in our country; especially those that are able to follow this model to serve our society and contribute to its sustainable development and consolidate the principle of social responsibility for capital and the owners of this money.</p>
<p>Community Jameel's initiatives and programs aiming at creating job opportunities for youth and the interest in innovation, entrepreneurship and creativity are an actual and tangible contribution to our national march towards the future.</p>

86712,"Mr. Ibrahim Abdulrahman Al-Belaihi","<p><strong>An Open-Handed Company</strong></p>
<p>I grew up with a passion for tracking human phenomena of all kinds; whether at the local, Arab level, Islamic, or even the global humanitarian level.  Driven by this overwhelming interest, I was keen on following, acquiring and reading thousands of translated books of different languages around the globe.  Not satisfied with only that, I also allocated thematically classified files for this purpose.  In doing so, it kept much of content published in the newspapers on the various aspects of the human being: the pros and cons; the atrocities of the world, and the great human aspects against evils.  Among the press reports I kept was press coverage on generous donations, humanitarian organizations, and charitable endowments in the United States of America.  The title of the press report was (Openhanded America), from which I quoted the title of this article.  I was used to tracing the donations of businessmen in different countries of the world.  For me, it felt very indignant that the wealthy Arabs do not have similar contributions, as the wealthy in America do.  Even the Rockefellers, whom some have attacked, made important contributions to the service of the American people.  We also find that the most prestigious American universities such as Harvard University, as well as the greatest and most famous hospitals; Like Mayo Clinic, were commenced as a charity.</p>
<p>Donations in the USA cover various fields, including founding universities, hospitals and multi-purpose scientific foundations.  The English scientist James Smithson donated all of his money to establish 'Smithsonian Institute' which aims at development and spreading knowledge in Washington, USA.  This charitable scientific project was established on a vast land that features museums and a scientific research institute.</p>
<p>In his book 'Screw It, Let's Do It: Lessons In Life' to the author Richard Branson, who is also a famous businessman, said: “It’s said that money is the root of all evil.  It doesn’t have to be.  Money can be used for good.  The biggest charities in the world were started by rich men and women, but some were begun with next to nothing.  Harvard, the wealthiest college in America, is a charitable trust.  IKEA is a charitable trust Big Mac gives USD 50 million a year to charity.  In the USA, a huge society was founded under the name of 'The Giving Pledge' that includes all wealthiest people in the USA and it was the beginning for huge donations.""</p>
<p>I happened to read that the world is home to about one hundred and thirty-eight thousand non-governmental charitable organizations, together employing two million permanent employees, with nearly 12 million volunteers.  Those organizations spend one hundred and twelve billion dollars in favor of the needy people in all different parts of the world.  In fact, the donations made by Bill Gates, Buffett, Zuckerberg and others, are not only generous but also huge.  They give the finest examples for the generous wealthy people.</p>
<p>However, generous denotations in the USA and all over the world aren’t limited to the companies or the wealthy businessmen.  Among my archives, I found a press report titled: 'In combating dearth in needy countries, peasants in Canada donate part of their crops'.  Further, I got another press report confirms that 'many foundations in the different parts of the USA are to allocate their charitable donations to children'.  The report added: 'there is a remarkable interest in children, particularly the projects supporting their education'.  Along the same lines, the Red Cross, Doctors without Borders and other humanitarian organizations were founded.</p>
<p>Over the past years, while I was reflecting on and rejoicing over these marvelous works, I was carrying the feelings of blame for the wealthy Arabs, many of whom were probably stingy even to pay the Zakat.  I was hunger for any news about any example of giving from local or Arab companies with huge resources.  Finally, I saw a flash, even a luminous torch spreading light in various directions.  Tracking the light, it was emanating from <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> Company , a generous organization with various effect-lasting contributions.  Most notably to know, Abdul Latif Jameel manages its charitable contributions with adequacy, accuracy and diligence.  In its contributions, it seeks the most beneficial aspect, with the most lasting benefit.  It does not give the needy meals, but it opens permanent doors for livelihood.  It does not give the hungry a fish to eat and then starve after hours.  But, as the famous proverb says, it teaches him fishing, so he secures his needs regularly, and sells to others what he catches, thus getting rid of poverty, and contributing to work and production.</p>
<p>In their book 'Corporate Social Responsibility', the two authors, Philip Kotler and Nancy Lee, state that: “Each dollar matters when it comes to funding schools'; therefore, Abdul Latif Jameel paid great attention to education, training and raising the awareness of the boys and girls to the promising sectors.</p>
<p>The Top Man in Abdul Latif Jameel, <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Eng. Mohammed Abdul Latif Jamee</a>l, is not only the managing leader, but also a man of culture, knowledge, thought, and highly diversified interests.  During my meeting with him and in the course of my communications and conversations with him, his patriotic enthusiasm was extremely glowing.  He has high keenness on developing his nation and securing its stability, derived by his loyalty to the political leadership.  He follows, hears, reads and discusses.  He always seeks to catch any national pulse that could be a spark for cooperation for the sake of national interest.  Despite being occupied by business, his wealth, social position and his lack of interest for someone like me, yet, I was surprised to receive his call and without any previous communication.  He said that he follows my intellectual activity and wishes to meet me in person.  We have agreed to the appointment and he honored me with his visit to my home in Riyadh.  During the meeting, he affirmed that he has this powerful passion to spread the enlightening notions within/outside the Saudi Arabian community.  Indeed, he doesn’t expect any personal benefit from an author like me, but this is part of his interest in the public domain.</p>
<p>Maybe what makes <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Eng. Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel</a> stand out among his counterparts is, I think, his outstanding interest in the national affairs, his keenness on serving people and his strong presence in the public domain.  He started many programs that care for different categories, and his national, social and cultural interests were unprecedentedly varied in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  He is worthy of the Order of King Abdulaziz – First Class.  And with his activity extended to the International arena; he was awarded the rank of Knight Commander (KBE), not to mention the so many awards and honors he received from various international cultural and scientific foundations. He is so enthusiastic when he speaks about the homeland, he reflects a rare sense of patriotism. </p>
<p>Without delving into any details regarding the contributions of the Company on the national, Arab and International levels, it might be sufficient to refer to the headlines of the fields where the company provides great social and humanitarian contributions.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel, through <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>, contributed in several developmental aspects, most notably:</p>
<p>First: <strong>Job Creation</strong></p>
<p>Launching <a href=""https://www.babjameeljobs.com/EN/"">Bab Rizq Jamee</a>l—or ‘beautiful gateway to prosperity’, which contributes in creating jobs for the youth in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recruitment</li>
	<li>Training</li>
	<li>Funding the small projects and productive families</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its establishment 18 years earlier, Bab Rizq Jameel contributed to provide 700 thousand employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Second: <strong>Arts</strong></p>
<p>Through <a href=""https://artjameel.org"">Art Jameel</a> and its affiliated centers that spread in Jeddah and <a href=""https://jameelartscentre.org"">Dubai</a>, Community Jameel supports artists and provides training on heritage and traditional arts, in addition to preserving the artifacts by launching the first open museum in Jeddah.  </p>
<p>Third: <strong>Health</strong></p>
<p>Establishing the first hospital to provide care for the people of special needs (<a href=""https://www.aljhospital.com/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Hospital in Jeddah</a>), and co-founding <a href=""https://www.kscdr.org.sa/en/"">King Salman Centre for Disability Research</a> in Riyadh.</p>
<p>It was also a co-founder of many international scientific centers such as <a href=""https://www.jclinic.mit.edu/"">Jameel Clinic</a> in <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a>, and the <a href=""https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jameel-institute"">Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics</a> (J-IDEA).</p>
<p>Fourth: <strong>Development</strong></p>
<p>The achievements include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a> (J-PAL) in MIT, whose co-founders received Nobel Peace Prize in 2019.</li>
	<li><a href=""https://jwafs.mit.edu/"">Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</a> (J-WAFS), MIT University.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fifth: <strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>Founding at MIT the <a href=""https://jwel.mit.edu/"">Abdul Latif Jameel World Education Lab</a> (J-WEL)</p>
<p>And <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/how-we-work/education/tanweer-jameel"">Tanweer Jameel</a> program for orphans</p>
<p>Indeed, each of the aforementioned titles involves great achievements, and various facilities.  The businessmen, in various fields, have a great role in providing services, in the prosperity of communities, and in the cultural progress.  It would be enough to mention the great contributions of Ferdinand de Lesseps, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Walt Disney, the pioneer of oil exploration in the USA “Drake”, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">نشأتُ مهتمًّا؛ بتتبُّع الظواهر البشرية من كافة الجوانب؛ سواء على المستوى المحلي، أو المستوى العربي، أو المستوى الاسلامي، أو المستوى الإنساني العالمي؛ وبدافعٍ من هذا الاهتمام المستحوذ؛ كنتُ أحرص على تتبع واقتناء وقراءة آلاف الكتب المترجَمة من مختلف لغات العالم. لكنني لم أكتف بذلك بل فتحتُ لهذا الغرض؛ ملفات موزَّعة موضوعيًّا؛ وبذلك احتفظتُ بالكثير مما تنشرها لصحف؛ عن مختلف الجوانب البشرية: الايجابيات والسلبيات؛ عن فظائع العالم، وعن الجوانب الانسانية العظيمة؛ المضادةَّ للشرور. ومن بين التقارير الصحفية التي احتفظت بها؛ تغطية صحفية؛ عن التبرعات السخية والجمعيات الانسانية، والأوقاف الخيرية في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية؛ وكان عنوان التقرير الصحفي (أمريكا المعطاءة) ومنه اقتبستُ عنوان هذه الكلمة. وكنت أتابع تبرعات رجال الأعمال في مختلف بلدان العالم؛ فأشعر بالامتعاض الشديد على أن الأثرياء العرب؛ ليست لهم إسهامات مماثلة. حيث نجد أن الأثرياء في أمريكا لهم إسهامات عظيمة، حتى روكفلر الذي هاجمه البعض؛ هو الآخر له إسهامات مهمة في خدمة الشعب الأمريكي. كما نجد أن أعرق الجامعات الأمريكية مثل جامعة هارفارد؛ وكذلك أعظم وأشهر المشافي؛ مثل مايو اكلنك؛ كان عملاًّ خيريًّا....</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">​         وتغطي التبرعاتُ في أمريكا مختلف المجالات؛ فهذا يقيم جامعة، وآخر يقيم مشفى، وثالث ينشئ مؤسسة علمية متعددة الأغراض؛ فالعالم الإنجليزي جيمس سميشون تبرع بكل أمواله لينشئ في واشنطن بالولايات المتحدة الأمريكية: (معهد سميشون : مؤسسة للتنمية ونشر المعرفة) لقد أقيم هذا المشروع العلمي الخيري على مساحة واسعة؛ تضم متاحف ومعهد الأبحاث العلمية ... </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">​         في كتابه (الاقتحام) يقول المؤلف رتشارد برانسون وهو رجل أعمال شهير: ((يقال إن المال رأس كل علة. ليس لزامًا أن يكون كذلك؛ إذْ يمكن استخدامه من أجل فعل الخير. لق أسَّس أكبرَ الجمعيات الخيرية في العالم؛ رجالٌ ونساءٌ أثرياء؛ هارفارد أغنى جامعة في أمريكا؛ هي وقفٌ خيري. شركة إيكيا هي وقفٌ خيري. بق ماك؛ مؤسس ماكدونالد تقدم شركته الآن مبلغ خمسين مليون دولار سنويا)) وفي الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية تم تأسيس جمعية ضخمة باسم (وعدٌ وعطاءٌ) تضم كبار الأثرياء الأمريكيين وقد كانت البداية تبرعات ضخمة للغاية ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">​         وقد قرأتُ بأنه يوجد هناك مائة وثمانية وثلاثون ألف مؤسسة أهلية خيرية؛ يعمل فيها مليونان من الموظفين الدائمين، يساعدهم (12) اثنى عشر مليون موظف متطوع، وتنُفق هذه المؤسسات الخيرية سنويًّا مائةً واثني عشر مليار دولار يتم إنفاقها على المحتاجين في مختلف أقطار العالم. إن تبرعات بيل جيتس، وبافيت، وزكيربيرج وغيرهم؛ هي تبرعات لا توصف فقط بأنها سخية للغاية بل إنها تبرعات هائلة، وتعُطي أمثلة رائعة لأثرياء الكرماء الأسخياء...</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">​         وليست التبرعات السخية في أمريكا وفي العالم؛ محصورة بالشركات، أو برجال الأعمال الأثرياء؛ ولكني أجد بين القصاصات؛ تقريراً صحفيًّا يقول: (لمكافحة المجاعة في الدول المحتاجة؛ الفلاحون في كندا؛ يتصدقون بجزء من محاصيلهم)) وأجد تقريراً صحفيًّا آخر يؤكد: ((أن الكثير من المؤسسات في مختلف أنحاء الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية؛ تتجه نحو تخصيص مساعداتها في مجال العمل الخيري للأطفال. ويضيف: ((يوجد اهتمامٌ ملحوظ بالصغار، وخصوصًا بالمشروعات ذات الصلة بتعليمهم)) وفي نفس الاتجاه؛ انُشئتْ منظمةُ الصليب الأحمر، ومنظمة أطباء بلا حدود وغيرها من المنظمات الإنسانية ...   </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">وخلال السنوات الماضية؛ بينما كنت أتأمل ذلك، وأبتهج به، وألوم الأثرياء العرب الذين ربما بخل الكثيرون منهم؛ حتى بإخراج الزكاة الواجبة. كنتُ أتصيّد أي خبر عن أي نموذج معطاء من الشركات المحلية أو العربية ذات الموارد الضخمة؛ أبصرت وميضًا بل وهَجًا مضيئاً؛ ينشر الضياء في مختلف الاتجاهات؛ ينبعث من شركة عبد اللطيف جميل المعطاءة؛ فالشركة تُقدّم عطاءاتٍ متنوعة ذات تأثير دائم، ومن الأهم أيضا الإشارة إلى أن شركة عبد اللطيف جميل، تدير إسهاماتها الخيرية بكفاية ودقة وعناية، إنها في إسهاماتها؛ تتحرى الأكثر نفعًا، والأدْوَم عطاءً؛ وكما في المثل؛ فإنها لا تعُطي المحتاجين وجبات غذائية، ولكنها تفتح لهم أبوابًا دائمة للرزق؛ فإنها لا تعطي الجائع سمكة يأكلها ثم يجوع بعد ساعات؛ ولكنها تعلمه كيف يصطاد هو السمك، فيتغذى هو بانتظام، ويبيع للآخرين مايصطاده، فيغتني عن الفقر، ويسُهم في العمل والانتاج ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">في كتاب (المسؤولية الاجتماعية للشركات) ينبه المؤلفان فيليب كوتلر ونانسي لي بأن: ((لكل دولار قيمة وأهمية؛ عندما يتعلق الإمر بتمويل المدارس)) لذلك اهتمت شركة عبد اللطيف جميل بالتعليم والتدريب وتوعية الفتيان والفتيات إلى المجالات الواعدة ...   </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">إن الرجل الأول في الشركة المهندس محمد عبد اللطيف جميل؛ ليس رجلَ إدارةٍ فقط، وإنما هو رجل ثقافة، ومعرفة، وفكر، واهتمامات متنوعة عالية. لقد لاحظت أثناء لقائي به وخلال التواصل معه، ومن أحاديثه، واهتماماته، وتواصُله، وإلحاحه الشديد على الهمِّ الوطني؛ أنه يتأجَّج حبّاً للوطن، ورغبةً في نمائه، وحرصًا على تطوره واستقراره، وإخلاصًا للقيادة السياسية. إنه يتابع، ويسمع، ويقرأ، ويناقش ويحاور. كما أنه يحاول أن يَتعرّف على أي نبضٍ وطني يستشعر فيه إمكانية التعاون من أجل المصلحة الوطنية؛ فرغم انشغاله، وثرائه، ومكانته الاجتماعية، واستغنائه عن أي فرد من أمثالي؛ إلا أنني قبل سنوات؛ ومن دون أي تعارف سابق؛ فوجئتُ به يتصل من جدة، يخبرني بأنه قد تابع نشاطي الفكري، وأنه يرغب في أن نلتقي، فاتفقنا على الموعد وزارني في بيتي في الرياض، وأثناء اللقاء أكّد رغبته القوية في نشر الأفكار التنويرية داخل المجتمع السعودي وخارجه. وبالطبع فهو لا يتوقع من كاتب مثلي أيّ نفع شخصي ولكن ذلك جزءٌ من اهتمامه بالشأن العام ...  </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">إن المهندس محمد عبد اللطيف جميل، الذي تميّز من بين رجال الأعمال بأنه؛ الأشد اهتمامًا بالشأن الوطني، وعنايةً بخدمة الناس، والأكثر حضوراً في الهم العام، فقد أنشأ العديد من البرامج التي تعُنى بمختلف الفئات؛ كما تنوعت اهتماماته الوطنية، والاجتماعية، والثقافية، بشكل غير مسبوق في المملكة؛ فاستحق بجدارة، وسام الملك عبد العزيز من الدرجة الأولى، وامتد نشاطه إلى الإسهام على المستوى العالمي فنال رتبة فارس في بريطانيا، كما تلقى احتفاءً، وجوائز، وتكريمًا، من مؤسسات ثقافية، وعلمية، عالمية، إنه حين يتحدث عن الوطن يتقد حماسًا يُعَبِّر عن وطنية ٍنادرة...</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">ومن دون الدخول في أي تفاصيل عن إسهامات الشركة الخيرية على المستوى الوطني والمستوى العربي والمستوى العالمي؛ يكفي أن أشير إلى العناوين الرئيسية للمجالات التي تقدِّم الشركة فيها إسهامات اجتماعية وإنسانية عظيمة ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">إن شركة عبد اللطيف جميل؛ ساهمت من خلال مؤسسة مجتمع جميل في العديد من المجلات التنموية ويأتي في مقدمة تلك المساهمات:</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">أولا: مجال خلق فرص العمل.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">تأسيس ( باب رزق جميل ) والذي يساهم؛ في خلقِ فرصِ عملٍ لشباب وشابات الوطن عبر ما يلي :</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">-   التوظيف</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">-   التدريب</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">-   تمويل المشاريع الصغيرة والأسر المنتجة.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">وقد بلغ عدد فرص العمل التي ساعد باب رزق جميل في توفيرها منذ بداية نشاطه قبل حوالي 18 عاما أكثر من 700 الف فرصة عمل.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">ثانيا: المجال الفنّي. وذلك من خلال تأسيس الفن جميل ومراكزه المنتشرة في كل من جدة ودبي إضافة الى التدريب على الفنون التراثية والمحافظة على المجسمات الجمالية من خلال تأسيس اول متحف مفتوح بمدينة جدة.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">ثالثا: المجال الصحي.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">تأسيس اول مستشفى لرعاية ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة (مستشفى عبد اللطيف جميل للتأهيل والرعاية). والمساهمة في مركز الملك سلمان لأبحاث الإعاقة. إضافة الى المراكز البحثية العلمية الدولية مثل عيادة جميل في جامعة ام اي تي وايضا معمل عبد اللطيف جميل في امبريال كوليج. </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">رابعا: مجلات التنمية.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">مثل:</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">*   معمل عبد اللطيف جميل لمكافحة الفقر في ام اي تي والذي حصل مؤسسوه على جائزة نوبل للسلام في عام 2019.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">*   معمل عبد اللطيف جميل للأمن الغذائي والمائي بجامعة ام اي تي.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">خامسا: مجال التعليم.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">من خلال تأسيس معمل عبد اللطيف جميل لتطوير التعليم العالمي بجامعة ام اي تي وبرنامج تنوير للأيتام.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">إن كل عنوان من هذه العناوين ينطوي على إنجازات كبيرة، وتسهيلات متنوعة. إن رجال الأعمال؛ في مختلف المجالات؛ لهم إسهامات عظيمة؛ في توفير الخدمات، وفي ازدهار المجتمعات، وفي تقدم الحضارة، ويكفي أن نتذكر الإسهامات العظيمة بل الحاسمة؛ لفرديناند دي ليسبس وتوماس إديسون، وهنري فورد، وأندروكارنجي، وجون روكفلر، وجون مورجان، ووالت ديزني، ورائد التنقيب عن النفط في أمريكا درايك، وبيل جيتس، وستيف جوبز، وإيلون ماسك. </p>

86832,"Sanjay E. Sarma","<p>I could wish <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel,</a> [congratulations] on its 75th anniversary  -  and I do wholeheartedly - but I wish for the World another 75 years of Community Jameel and the spirit of Community Jameel, because the world needs it.</p>
<p>You know, MJ [<a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jameel</a>] has been someone who has taken on the topics that others won't fund despite being fundamental to the future of our planet.  Poverty: which corporation cares for poverty, a few foundations do, but for Mohammed to create <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a>, takes vision and a certain courage, and a certain amount of gravitas to say: 'we will take it on, and we will make a difference.'</p>
<p>Water and food security: again, water is everywhere and it's soon going to be in short supply, and yet MJ thinks and recognizes it's fundamental.  Education: education is a little bit orphaned.  And the future of education, rethinking education, this is something we have to do as countries around the world start . . .  their economies start reshaping and education becomes important.  And <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed</a> comes and says: 'let's take it on', right . . .   So, his generosity is such that it empowers <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a>, and the other entities that Community Jameel has funded to take on problems that others won't.  And that to me is. very special, liberating, inspiring, and for many of us it's been a life-changing thing because we've gotten into these fields because of MJ.</p>
<p>Even before COVID-19  struck, it was clear that education was going to have to reshape itself. COVID of course, has brought into stark focus.  <a href=""https://jwel.mit.edu/"">The [Abdul Latif] Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL)</a> looks at education and reconstitutes it in ways that are more efficacious, more effective, more affordable, more impactful on students.  Whether it's, you know, the science of learning, or the practice of teaching, or labs, or the training of teachers.  All aspects of that, the leadership of universities at three different levels: one is the K-12 level, the second is in 'higher ed.' and the third is in the adult education, that is people in the workforce.   It looks at creating new scenarios for education such that we can make a direct impact on people's lives and on economies.  And it's a consortium and we have dozens of companies, countries, regions, universities, schools, working together to share best practices and to learn from each other, and also to bring together the best expertise MIT and our ecosystem has, to look at the future of education.</p>
<p>Now this was all important even before COVID but COVID has put it in sharp contrast.  The urgent need for rethinking education and J-WEL has put us in a very good place now, in the post COVID era, to take on this incredible challenge that humanity faces.</p>
<p>You know, all the centers at MIT carry the name of the patriarch of the Jameel family: Abdul Latif Jameel.  I have not had the pleasure of meeting him, obviously, but he is clearly a man who created both an extraordinary industry, but also launched a family of public servants -  people who really care about humanity.  Of course I've already talked about Mohammed.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/fady-jameel/"">Fady Jameel</a> is the person who actually signed and attended the inauguration of the Jameel World Education Lab.  He is someone deeply interested in art and in the humanities.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/hassan-jameel"">Hassan Jameel</a> is very interested in <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/news/listing/Abdul-Latif-Jameel-World-Education-Lab-at-MIT-and-Save-the-Children-come-together"">refugees in the education</a> space and also in technology.  Hassan and I . . .   <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/hassan-jameel/"">Hassan</a> invited me actually to an event in <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/news/listing/leaders-commit-to-urgent-support-for-refugees"">Jordan</a> where he led a very passionate discussion of the plight of refugees and how education could help with <a href=""https://jameel75.com/en/stories/HM-Queen-Rania-Al-Abdullah/?LjuQKXzQTT"">Queen Rania</a> and others dominaries from around the Middle East present.  And it so it is clearly a family that cares deeply.   It's not just one generation it's three generations clearly.  And then there's the extended family - whether it's <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/community-jameel-team/amna-fatani"">Amna</a> or <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/community-jameel-team/george-richards"">George Richards</a> - of people who carry this spirit forward.</p>
<p>So, to me Community Jameel is truly a community.  It's it's an extended family of caring individuals who have been passionate about topics, about issues that matter to the world.</p>

86894,"Waleed Al-Ibrahim","<p>Walt Disney said: <em>'If you can dream it, you can do it.</em>'  When I remember this saying, I recall the many of the early innovators who followed the path of success with steady and confident steps, in a sea of ​​challenges and changes, then attained what they dreamed of, and accomplished what they worked for.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most prominent of these is Abdul Latif Jameel may Allah rest his soul, the founding father of the pioneering company that is capably managed today by my brother <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammad Abdul Latif Jameel</a>, to whom I give my heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Company's establishment.</p>
<p>In this occasion I would like to point out that pioneering initiatives and successful businesses cannot thrive or bear fruit, or have real value unless it is coupled with a human aspect that is based on giving and commitment to community concerns (institutions and individuals) through social service in its various forms, and the innovative initiatives of sustainable results.  In practice, such initiatives are indispensable for building a comprehensive community ecosystem that is based on  empowering human being and enhancing his competitiveness being the most important human capital and the most valuable asset in our life.</p>
<p>The goal remains to convey the bright image of the talented, innovative and creative Saudi citizen to the region and the world.  From here, I would like to commend Abdul Latif Jameel's <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">community initiatives</a> for 75 years of dedication and giving, most notably <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a> and Bab Rizq Jameel and many others.  Those initiatives have indeed contributed to the creation of tens of thousands of job opportunities for young men and women in our beloved country Saudi Arabia.  They also help to hone skills, training and link higher education with the labor market opportunities and requirements.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to say to my brother <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Abdul Latif Jamee</a>l and his team spread over the five continents I am confident that the next 75 years will bear many initiatives and successes more than what we have witnessed in past years, Inshallah.</p>

<p>Honorable Mr. Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel<br />
Chairman, Abdul Latif Jameel<br />
Founder &amp; Chairman of Community Jameel</p>
<p>Peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be upon you,</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> on the occasion of the 75th anniversary and the continuation of the successful march in the commercial and charitable fields, both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel is one of the most important Saudi commercial organizations that has been keen to consolidate the concept of social responsibility in the private sector.  It has been always a distinguished role model for private businesses in launching and supporting many community initiatives, including qualification and training, employment, health, scientific research, culture and arts, and the revival of traditional crafts.</p>
<p><a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jameel</a>’s initiatives have been pioneering in creating effective partnerships between the Saudi government sector and civil organizations.  It also contributed to providing innovative solutions with a focus on development programs and promoting individual capabilities, in addition to its leading partnerships with Saudi and international universities to serve scientific research.</p>
<p>As for <a href=""https://www.babjameeljobs.com/EN/"">Bab Rizq Jameel</a>, an initiative of Community Jameel that was launched in Saudi Arabia, it is very close to myself for two reasons: it was one of the charitable causes that captured the interest of my father, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, and he used to praise it in many of our family gatherings, for being focusing on qualifying women and empowering them economically.  The second reason is that I have touched a personality through my visit to their centers, how Bab Rizq Jameel contributed to improving the lives of women who benefited from it and supported them in leading a decent life that every woman diligently pursues to improve her financial and social position.</p>
<p>Abdul Latif Jameel has formed a global Saudi model that demonstrates the importance of private sector’s role in serving society, and has achieved the equation of excellence in global business and charitable initiatives in various fields and in many countries.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship and service of humanity is a lofty mission that was initiated by the late Sheikh Abdul Latif Jameel, whose vision and approach are still continuing and developing by his son, Mr. <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a>, may Allah bless his generous efforts and commendable strides for the good of mankind.</p>

<p>No doubt the awareness and the social role of companies and the importance of the initiatives and programs of social responsibility has increased dramatically recently, after many companies and establishments have realized their duties to their communities and went into a competition in implementing different and varied social initiatives.</p>
<p>The good thing is that all business sectors have also realized that social responsibility is not just a charitable activity to be carried out during a limited period of time and then ends, but to the contrary it is a sustainable activity and a key part of the activities of various companies and establishments of different types.</p>
<p>In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, specifically, the concept of social responsibility is an integral part of the structure of private sector entities of all kinds.</p>
<p>These efforts  are also promoted and supported by the government agencies that have enabled the private sector to do its part, by providing the companies and establishments with all facilities to launch social programs and initiatives marked by a critical component which is sustainability.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.communityjameelsaudi.org/en"">Community Jameel Saudi</a> is a role model for companies that gave the social responsibility the care and attention it deserves.</p>
<p>They have my all my sincere thanks, appreciation and best wishes for continued success.</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">ولا شك بأن الوعي والدور المجتمعي للشركات وأهمية مبادرات وبرامج المسؤولية الاجتماعية قد تعاظم بشكل كبير مؤخراً بعد أن أدركت الشركات والمؤسسات واجباتها تجاه مجتمعاتها وأصبحت تتنافس في تنفيذ مبادرات اجتماعية مختلفة ومتنوعة. والأمر الجيد أن كافة قطاعات الأعمال قد أدركت كذلك أن المسؤولية الاجتماعية ليست مجرد عمل خيري يتم تنفيذه خلال فترة زمنية محدودة وينتهي الأمر، ولكنها على العكس نشاط مستدام وجزء أصيل من أنشطة الشركات والمؤسسات على مختلف أنواعها.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">وفي المملكة العربية السعودية تحديداً يشكل مفهوم المسؤولية الاجتماعية جزء أصيل من نسيج منشآت القطاع الخاص على مختلف أنواعها، وقابل ذلك توفر التحفيز والدعم من قبل الجهات الحكومية التي مكنت القطاع الخاص من القيام بدورها ويسرت للشركات والمؤسسات إطلاق برامج ومبادرات اجتماعية تميزت بعنصر بالغ الأهمية وهو الاستدامة مؤسسة مجتمع جميل نموذج للشركات التي أولت المسؤولية الاجتماعية ما تستحقه من رعاية واهتمام. فلهم مني الشكر والتقدير وأطيب التمنيات بدوام التوفيق.</p>

<p>I've only been working at Community Jameel for a relatively short amount of time.  I have a background in international development and I've always been very much aware of Community Jameel, as have my colleagues, and when we had the opportunity to work with Community Jameel we didn't know what to expect and we were so impressed by the innovative approach to programing.  And now that I've worked for Community Jameel I'm so proud to be accepted into this into this Family into this team.</p>
<p>The first person in the Family that I met was <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/hassan-jameel"">Hassan</a>.  And, we were about to go into a meeting in Jordan and I was terrified because I didn't know what to expect and I obviously wanted to make a really good impression.  And I went in, and he was so incredibly kind and so professional.  He always referred to me and always brought me into the conversation.  He was just always aware of the people that surrounded him and it was that sense of compassion.  And again it's kind of instilled into Community Jameel and the way that we conduct our programing, the kind of awareness and the consideration to the community.</p>
<p>Even in our scholarship programs at the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/how-we-work/education/bocelli-jameel-scholarship"">Royal College of Music</a> and <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/how-we-work/education/jameel-toyota-scholarship-at-mit"">MIT, </a>the Family are always concerned about the students. They're always asking about them and  they're always asking for us to find any opportunity to promote the students.  It really is just a genuine sense of caring about about people.</p>
<p>So, a lot of organizations they would look at the world look at the problems and they would say 'okay that is unsolvable we won't be able to tackle that one' and that is the complete opposite way of working at Community Jameel - l the harder the better!  They'll watch a documentary, they'll read a newspaper article and it'll be 'oh this is the problem that nobody's been able to to crack' and that, it's really inspiring because when you first get you're like oh this seems too complicated and then the way that, again, they're able to ,like you know, dissect that information, the way that they're able to corral this international efforts of academics, is something that Community Jameel does.  It's something that the Family does, and they do it incredibly well.</p>
<p>I want to say congratulations to the Family for 75 years.  I'm at the start of my journey but I am so excited at the future - and if it's anything like what the last little while has been like, I know that it's going to be innovative, it's going to be daring, and it's going to, I think, tackle some of the world's biggest problems and I know that we'll find solutions.  I have that much faith in the organization and the Family.  Thank you.</p>

<p>This is my third year with Community Jameel.  It's been a whirlwind of three years. Really exciting time for us as an organization and and exciting chapter of the next 75 years.</p>
<p>Community Jameel is an organization that strives to innovate for a better future; what that means for us is that we develop programs with different partners around the world that looks at creating the environments with which scientific and technological breakthroughs can achieve can be achieved through research data and  technology, in the areas of climate health and education.  And then we take those breakthroughs and we try to bridge and distribute the benefits of those breakthroughs to the people who need them the most.  My role is to help co-develop programs with our partners such as <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a> and <a href=""https://imperial.ac.uk"">Imperial College London</a> and local partners as well from the region to develop programs that are designed for impact and also based on real needs and the local needs on the ground. it's such an exciting organization to be part of.  It's such an exciting family to be part of.  The vision of the Jameel Family and trying to help them achieve that vision, thinking about strategic ways in which we can do better, have more impact with much less, kind of investments.  In my three years here I've felt I've had a lot of conversations and I've worked really closely with the family and I really felt a part of that extended family and almost, in a way, I feel like the Jameel Family's vision is my vision, towards making the world a better place  and innovating for a better future.</p>
<p>I'd like to congratulate the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel Family</a> for the 75 year anniversary and really excited to be part of the next 75 years and see what the future holds for us.</p>

87644,"Dr. Simba Gill","<p>I first met <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed</a> through a partnership, and I think a <em>partnership</em> embodies much of what's been remarkable about the <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> community over the last 75 years,  and our partnership is focused on something where Mohammed and I have a shared vision.  Which is really trying to tackle what we see as one of the world's most urgent and most important issues.  How  do we discover, develop and deliver innovative and transformative medicines, for all people in the world, with particular focus on what will soon be two billion people in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>What's been very refreshing working with Mohammed, and her broader team, is that right from the outset the driver has been: 'how do we help people?'  And, 'how do we <em>really</em> make a difference?'  And that's, as I said just incredibly refreshing in the modern world.</p>
<p>I'm very sure that actually, as we look forward over the next 75 years, Mohammed and the team at Abdul Latif Jameel, will actually help the health care of  billions of people in Africa and the Middle East  - and how wonderful is that?</p>
<p>What is amazing, is that that's only a tiny piece of what Abdul Latif Jameel is focused on.  And it's always a joy to spend time with Mohammed, because the topics of our discussion range from how do we end world poverty; to discussions about the wonderful world of art; through to the changing world of energy; the changing world of transportation, the movement to electric vehicles; how do we think about fundamentally changing healthcare . . .   and many many more topics.  But in all of those areas Abdul Latif Jameel is having a fundamental impact and really playing a role in accelerating the arrival of a better future.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to congratulate Mohammed and the broader team Abdul Latif Jameel for an amazing 75 years.  I, personally, am looking forward to the next 75 years and many more celebrations and to living in a better and better world, in which Mohammed and the team at Abdul Latif Jameel will have played a fundamental world role in creating.</p>

87801,"John Rossant","<p>I had the i have the the honor and the privilege and the pleasure, to know <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/mohammed-abdul-latif-jameel/"">Mohammed Jameel</a> and his family for many, many years.  In fact, when I was a very young journalist I went to Saudi Arabia and met <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed Jamee</a>l and his father, Sheikh Abdul Latif Jameel - who was an extremely impressive man - but Mohammed and I, roughly the same age, we struck a friendship that's endured over decades.</p>
<p>What's, I think, so incredible about the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel Family</a> in the DNA.  I think there's a real desire to make the world a better place and I know that sounds like sort of a cliché, but in this case it's not.  And I think it's very deeply held notion.  I remember maybe 25, 20, years ago, or so, Mohammed showing me in Jeddah, the work of Bab Rizq Jameel, which at the time was helping to train disadvantaged young Saudis, in ways to support themselves and make a living, and build their own businesses so they could provide for themselves and their families.  But then over the years I<i> </i>sort of saw this philanthropy elsewhere.</p>
<p>If I think of the support that Mohammed Jameel has given and his family have given to MIT, for example, throughout the years, with the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a>, I mean these are really important, deep, activities that are improving people's lives, doing extremely positive things, who raise people out of poverty to look at ways to which families can create livelihoods.  That's so important.  And if you look, also, on the business side, I think what's been extraordinary is how Mohammed and his family really walk the walk and not only talk the talk.  I mean, they've, for years, been investing in a very, very smart way, in <a href=""https://frv.com"">renewable energies</a>, in <a href=""https://rivian.com"">zero emission</a> transportation, in <a href=""https://aljhealth.com"">biotech</a>.  In areas that will make the world a better place in the future and I have just enormous respect for that approach.</p>
<p>So, I really want to congratulate Mohammed his whole family <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/fady-jameel/"">Fady</a>, <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/our-people/hassan-jameel/"">Hassan</a>, all the teams at <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> and <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">Community Jamee</a>l for the wonderful and important work that they're doing and I know it will continue, and expand, and bring a lot of good to the world.</p>

<p>Dear Mohammed,</p>
<p>Reaching 75 years is remarkable for any company, and at Cambridge we are delighted to congratulate <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a>, and to celebrate with you.</p>
<p>Achieving this milestone is hardly surprising, given your family’s passion, dedication and commitment to serving others, inspired, of course, by the pioneering spirit of the late Abdul Latif Jameel.  Cambridge is honoured to have had its own relationship with the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel family</a> for almost two decades.  Almost halfway through my tenure as Vice-Chancellor, I have grown to cherish the privilege of developing relationships with generous supporters such as the Jameels, whose commitment to solving global challenges is making a real difference, enabling truly life-changing work.</p>
<p>That includes the Cambridge Interfaith Programme (CIP), which promotes understanding of the complex and diverse relationships between religious traditions and the secular world.  Through such understanding comes the flourishing of ideas and the ability to work together to build a better future.</p>
<p>We are profoundly grateful to the Jameel family for enabling the CIP to become a pre-eminent centre for interfaith engagement, attracting outstanding researchers, and setting a foundation on which to build projects that have been emulated at institutions from the US to India to China.  From projects researching the place of religion in modern universities to evaluating the place of religion in serving the common good; from symposiums and summer schools to the publication of a book on scripture and violence, the CIP is at the forefront of developments in religious thought, and ranks amongst the very top programmes in the world.</p>
<p>Through developing links between academia and government and fostering dialogue among policymakers, charities, and museums, the CIP has been able to encourage discussion and respect among communities both nationally and internationally.  The CIP’s A Common Word, a statement of peace and friendship, was signed by more than 130 Muslim scholars.  Christian leaders including Pope Benedict responded and the initiative inspired major international conferences and more than 600 articles in English. </p>
<p>Such projects make a profound contribution towards peace.</p>
<p>Once more I congratulate you and your family on your tremendous achievements.  Your father’s legacy continues to resonate through your generous <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en"">philanthropy</a>, and I thank you for placing your trust in Cambridge to fulfil your mission of interfaith and intercultural understanding.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>I became involved with <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> and <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en"">Community Jameel</a> and <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family/mohammed-jameel-kbe"">Mohammed</a> and his <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">family</a> with the creation of the Jameel Clinic at MIT which was formed with a tremendously generous gift from Abdul Latif Jameel and Community Jameel.  In the context of the Jameel Clinic I came together with <a href=""https://www.regina.csail.mit.edu/"">Regina Barzilay,</a> my faculty co-lead, and we together, launched the antibiotics AI initiative in the context of Jameel Clinic and already have discovered a new antibiotic called <a href=""https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220"">Halicin</a>, which is effective against multi-drug resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and pan-resistant bacterial pathogens.  And we think with the antibiotics AI project, and the support of Abdul Latif Jameel and Community Jameel, we can harness the power of AI to address the antibiotic crisis giving us a significant competitive advantage in the battle of our wits against the genes of bacterial pathogens.</p>
<p>You know, Community Jameel and Abdul Latif Jameel has had a tremendous global impact.  Really addressing under addressed needs.  This includes healthcare, education water needs and poverty, and in each of those areas Abdul Latif Jameel, Community Jameel has launched, what have become now we're leading research centers at MIT.</p>
<p>I think they're unique in their scope and unique in their interest in having an impact that takes the best innovations we have at MIT and translates them into differences that truly impact people's lives.</p>
<p>So Mohammed and his sons are, very much hands-on collaborators as philanthropists.  We have become great friends over the past few years in the context of Jameel Clinic as well as colleagues and Mohammed and his sons are remarkable in their reach around the world and are always looking to see how they can help advance our projects. So, it very much, U don't view them simply as supporters but as collaborators.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Mohammed and his family, and their team at Abdul Latif Jameel and Community Jameel.  75 years is a remarkable anniversary it's 20 years longer than I have been on  this planet.  And I am very excited to see what Community Jameel will do in the coming decades.  I don't think I have 75 more years but I'm convinced the Community Jameel will have many more than 75 more years to have an impact on this world.</p>
<p>I've, again, I've really appreciated the friendship that I formed Mohammed and his sons and it's rare to establish a relationship with the funder at the level that I've been able to do with Mohammed and his sons, and really be excited to see what we're going to be able to do together as a team.  Identifying  problems that need technological innovation and actually bringing the resource together both capital but even more so the intellectual resources that can make a difference. </p>

<p>Personally, I'm proud of this Company as a Saudi citizen.  it is so successful that no Saudi home is left without a product from Abdul Latif Jameel, or at least no home has not tried their products.  </p>
<p>Frankly, I thank Abdul Latif Jameel for their support for motorsport, this support is deep-rooted and not born out of this moment.  With <a href=""http://www.yazeedracing.com/"">Yazeed</a>, they launched a youth development project which is the 'RAV4 Project', that produced rally champions.  Their fingerprints are clear in this athletic area, and in other areas.</p>
<p>Today, praise be to Allah, the partnership with the Yazeed Team has yielded its fruits by winning the Kingdom Championship, and other achievements in international tournaments.  I thank them for this continuous support.</p>
<p>Of course, when we talk about the <a href=""https://www.communityjameel.org/en/who-we-are/jameel-family"">Jameel's</a> <a href=""https://www.communityjameelsaudi.org/en"">philanthropic initiatives</a>, and its support for the Saudi economy, we need volumes to be written.  it provided almost SR 2.5 billion to Saudi citizens.  It helped create 350 thousand job opportunities, not to mention other initiatives such as 'productive families' and other projects.  I mean, honestly, you need books to be written in this regard.  I personally congratulate them, I congratulate them as a Saudi citizen.  I thank them for their accomplishments, and I with them all the best in this impressive march.</p>
<p>I wish all companies and all businessmen to follow the example of what Abdul Latif Jameel offers in contributing to the renaissance of Saudi Arabia's economy.</p>

<p>So, growing-up, obviously, I was familiar with the operations in Saudi Arabia, be it on the automotive side and the financial industry side.  But as I grew up I started to appreciate the philanthropy they were doing and the investments in education.  I was a nerd at heart, and maybe still am, in high school I was very passionate about scientific research and when I learned about the <a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a> lab that they had sponsored at <a href=""https://mit.edu"">MIT</a> and which later went on to win a Nobel Prize, I found that to be a great point of pride and something that I took very profoundly.</p>
<p>So, to be in a position now, within my business to partner with Abdul Latif Jameel as an investor, and as a partner for <a href=""https://www.leantech.me/"">Lean Technologies</a>, is something I really take a great amount of pride in.  Not to mention, obviously, the great joy I have from interacting with everyone on the Abdul Latif Jameel side, when we do interact with them.</p>
<p>So, to everyone at Abdul Latif Jameel - and the broader ecosystem - as you're celebrating your 75th birthday, I tell you that we're incredibly proud of the work that you're doing, not only as a Saudi citizen, but as a citizen of the World, I can tell you that you guys are doing incredible work!  So, here's to 75 more years of prosperity and cheers to you guys!</p>",en,,671544,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/06/Hisham-Al-Falih-h.png,video,,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/06/Abdul-Latif-Jameel-75-Voices-Hisham-Al-Falih-Lean-Tech-EN-16x9-C.mp4,https://media.alj.com/app/uploads/2021/06/Hisham-Al-Falih-t.png,"<p>Founder and Chief Executive Officer<br />

My father David and I wanted to express our deepest regards on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> group by your father.</p>
<p>Both David and I have immense respect for what you and your father have been achieving not only on the business side but also on the socio-economic front and the artistic stage.  No doubt such accomplishments over the course of a number of decades have been driven by a set of values and aspirations in which we, as a family group, recognize ourselves.</p>
<p>We were in particular impressed by the fundamental role you played in the development of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (<a href=""https://www.povertyactionlab.org/"">J-PAL</a>) at the MIT, laying the ground for my compatriot Esther Duflo, Founder of the J-PAL, to be awarded for her work on poverty alleviation, together with her husband and her colleague, the <a href=""https://www.alj.com/en/news/congratulations-to-leading-economists-at-mit-for-nobel-prize/"">Nobel Prize for Economics</a> in 2019 – the second time in history a woman wins the Prize.</p>
<p>Further, my father and I truly admire the active and inspirational patronage activities you have been deploying in the art sphere - whether it is at the Victoria and Albert Museum or the <a href=""https://jameelartscentre.org/"">Jameel Arts Center</a> in Dubai.</p>
<p>My father and I look forward to nurturing the ties between our respective families and will ensure this friendship and trust are passed on from generation to generation.</p>

On behalf of <a href=""https://www.mashreqbank.com/"">Mashreq</a>, I would like to extend our most heartfelt congratulations to the <a href=""https://alj.com"">Abdul Latif Jameel</a> company on this milestone <a href=""https://jameel75.com"">75th anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>You should feel immensely proud of the last three quarters of a century, in which your family’s business has been a stellar example of a thriving regional business and which – importantly – has always sought to lend a helping hand with selfless philanthropical activity.</p>
<p>At Mashreq, our relationship with the Abdul Latif Jameel company began in 2014. </p>
<p>During this time, we’ve been nothing but impressed with the extremely professional and dedicated management – and teams – of the group.  It’s clear that it is this professionalism that has propelled the group to becoming one of the most recognizable brands in the world.</p>
<p>We are immensely proud of the fact that the Abdul Latif Jameel Group and Mashreq share the same vision when it comes to <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">philanthropic activities</a> and initiatives.</p>
<p>Both organizations believe that businesses can play a pivotal role in helping people and addressing the most pressing challenges of our time, as exemplified by the ALJ Group’s support of communities around the world and dedication to the <a href=""https://jameel75.com/en/sdg"">UN’s Sustainability Goals</a>.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we are proud and excited to continue our close collaboration together, as well as celebrating future milestones with you.</p>

<p>At Mashreq, we have watched as Abdul Latif Jameel has flourished for several decades, from modest roots to an organization with businesses across six continents and a source of employment and income to so many families. It holds a global reach and an impact that aligns with so many of the values we share and celebrate at Mashreq.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of our collaboration in multiple countries, including Egypt and the UAE, we have had the pleasure of witnessing first-hand the extremely professional - indeed visionary - leadership from the Group's management.  It is recognized for its success in making a lasting social impact through its <a href=""https://communityjameel.org"">philanthropic</a> causes and diverse business operations.</p>
<p>It is this strategic partnership that is exciting, energetic, successful, and always evolving, to the benefit of both parties - and a relationship that I look forward to seeing flourish in the future. <br />
